mac.1.t:0 "마가군벌 소개"
mac.1.d:0 "마가군벌은 1880년대 이래로 청나라 아래에서 일했던 수많은 중국인 총독들로 이루어져 있습니다. 마씨 가문부터가 하나의 거대한 가문이 아니라 지배 지역에서 권력을 나누어 가진 세 가족들의 통합체일 뿐입니다. 첫 번째 가족은 1918년 가주 마안링이 죽은 이후부터 그늘에 가려진 상태입니다. 지금은 주로 두번째와 세번째 가족이 군벌을 주도하고 있으며, 이후 군벌은 여기서 번창하는 중입니다.\n\n신해혁명이 일어났을 때 마안링이 이끌던 마가군벌은 처음에는 청나라의 편을 들었지만, 패배가 명백해지자 청을 배신하고 공화국 편을 들었습니다. 이후 마가군벌은 북쪽의 몽골과 남쪽의 티베트 양쪽 모두에게 공화국이 정당한 정부라는 사실을 강제로 인정받으며 서북부 중국 내에서 안정을 다졌습니다. 조만간 1918년 마안링이 사망하자 마가군벌은 크게 두 파벌로 갈라졌습니다. 간쑤와 닝샤를 지배하는 마부팡이 주도하는 일파와 조만간 칭하이의 지배권을 손에 넣게 될 마치가 주도하는 일파가 바로 그들입니다.\n\n하지만 얼마 지나지 않아 국민군이 남부 간쑤를 점령하자 군벌 구성원들은 한 편으로 모일 수 밖에 없었고 펑위샹 아래로 집결하게 되었습니다. 그러나 국민군의 패배가 점점 더 가시화 되자 소수를 제외한 대부분의 군벌들은 편을 바꾸어 직예 군벌편으로 돌아섰습니다.\n\n직예 군벌이 청 황조를 복원하는 동안에도 충성을 지킨 마씨 일가는 비록 모든 파벌들이 중국 영토를 지키기 위해 목숨걸지는 않을지라도 대체로 신뢰할 수 있는 존재로 받아들여지고 있습니다. 항상 싸울 준비가 되어 있는 청 황조의 중요한 일원으로 발돋움한 지금은 쑤이위안까지도 지배합니다."

mac.2.t:0 "세개의 중심"
mac.2.d:0 "마씨 가문은 닝샤, 간쑤 그리고 새로 차지한 영토인 칭하이 이렇게 세 지역을 지배합니다.\n\n닝샤와 간쑤는 모두 북부 마씨가 지배하고 있으며 간쑤 총독에는 마푸샹이 임명되었고 닝샤 총독에는 그의 조카인 마홍빈이 임명되었습니다. 군벌이 사용하는 무기 대부분이 생산되는 타이위안 병기창이 있고 가장 많은 인구를 자랑하는 간쑤는 군벌이 점령하고 있는 힘 대부분이 나오는 지역입니다. 다만 최근 국민군의 피비린내나는 점령기 동안 민간 산업이 쇠퇴하여 간쑤 지역의 명성도 예전같지 않습니다. 또한 현재 위험한 젊은 군벌 마중잉이 북부에서 넓은 지역을 지배한 채 잔인한 통치를 이어가고 있는 상태입니다. 닝샤 지역은 마가군벌 인력풀에서 큰 부분을 차지하며 많은 말을 보유하고 있고 언제든지 군으로 징집 가능한 도적떼도 많습니다. 평화 시기에는 닝샤의 장점이 빛이 바래지만 전쟁이 다가온다면 밝게 빛나며 가치를 드러낼 겁니다.\n\n마가군벌 남부 지역에 최근 얻은 땅인 칭하이는 현재 마린지 지배권을 행사합니다. 칭하이는 아마도 서북부에서 가장 낙후된 촌동네일지도 모르며 인구 대부분이 여전히 유목 생활을 유지하고 있기 때문에 시닝과 같은 주요 도시 거주자는 극히 소수입니다. 남부 지역은 마가군벌과 티베트가 영유권 문제로 강하게 충돌하면서 뺏고 뺏기기를 반복하는 지역입니다. 그 주에서도 갈등의 중심이 되는 지역인 우슈에서는 1930년대 초 내내 계속해서 소규모 교전이 벌어졌습니다. 갈등은 어느 정도 진정된 상황이지만 현재 상황이 언제까지 유지될지는 아무도 모릅니다. 시닝의 정치계는 현재 총독 마린과 그의 조카 마부팡이 주도권을 두고 다투는 중인데, 마린 총독이 패배하고 축출될 것으로 예상하는 사람들이 많습니다. 마부팡은 날이 가면 갈수록 점점 더 고립되는 마린을 제쳐두고 더 많은 사람을 자기 주변으로 끌어들이는 중입니다."

Within the hour, the Tibetan forces surrendered to the combined strength of the two forces. What came next was a complete shock to Cai, however.\n\nMa Biao himself started going up to every soldier who surrendered, nearly 800 altogether, and began shooting them one by one. When he ran out of ammo, he switched to his Dao and continued, creeping up to each young soldier and mercilessly killing them. "Am I the only one who will join into this sport?", was said by Ma Biao once he finished the 100th soldier, with the rest of the regiment having joined into the massacre as well, until all the surrendered were dead. Cai contemplated on if he made the wrong choice here, but the die had already been cast on his part. There was no turning back unless he wanted him and his entire tribe to end up like those fallen. Ma Biao and the rest of his men alongside Cai moved further into Qinghai, as the continuation of conflict was inevitable after such an act."
