### Focuses ###
Russia_Socialist:0 "러시아 중점계통도"

SOV_Proletarian_Humanism:0 "프롤레타리아 휴머니즘"
SOV_Proletarian_Humanism_desc:0 "Through his rhetorical skills and clever maneuvering, Bukharin's vision Russia and beyond has seen him retain his dominant role in the All-Union Communist Party. He supports a course of socialism at a snail's pace, to avoid the creation of a massive state bureaucracy and preserve the victories of the proletariat in the recent revolution."

SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict:0 "도시와 농촌의 갈등해소"
SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict_desc:0 "In our land there is a great struggle between the cities and the countryside, between the developed lands and the deprived farmlands, between factory workers and peasants. One of our first steps in preserving the revolution is to overcome this divide so that we may combine our efforts against the oppressors rather than bickering among ourselves."

SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation:0 "자발적 집산화"
SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation_desc:0 "Russia had barely begun to move beyond feudalism by the time we liberated the country. The New Economic Policy of the Soviet Republic should include a program of voluntary farm collectivization, something that will allow the poorest peasants to unite and pool their resources together without uprooting the entire agricultural system."

SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation:0 "공업화 진행"
SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation_desc:0 "The superindustrialism of the left-wing of the party will lead to a massive state bureaucracy which will dominate over the proletariat. Only a moderate industrialization, one which also preserves the Smychka, which is a necessary requirement in the short-term, will be a successful one, preventing much issues in its path."

SOV_Control_The_Unions:0 "노동조합 통제"
SOV_Control_The_Unions_desc:0 "We currently have a parallelism of unions and the administrative organs, an issue which needs to be remedied. While this we will also have to change the essence of unions, from 'trade' unions to 'production' unions. The newly created administrative-economic apparatus will be democratically elected by the workers, with broad mass assemblies of all economic-production measures."

SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation:0 "관료주의 혁파"
SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation_desc:0 "The fight against the bureaucracy is a constant fight, something Lenin already understood. We will have to fight the bureaucracy, before it can establish itself already, something we have to avoid at all costs. We will also have to train truly proletarian bureaucrats to slowly replace the reactionary bureaucrats we still have plenty of."

SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard:0 "혁명전위대"
SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard_desc:0 "After a long struggle, Karl Radek's vision for a revolutionary future has won out against all others. A radical among radicals, he is a firebrand, insisting that primitive socialist accumulation and five-year plans will allow the production of the productive forces necessary to begin the transition towards socialism."

SOV_Mass_Collectivisation:0 "대중 집산화"
SOV_Mass_Collectivisation_desc:0 "The farmlands of Russia's great expanses have never been controlled by the farmer, but instead by the Grand Prince, the Tsar and the capitalist. This repression of the worker cannot be allowed to persist, and as such we must embark on a radical program of rapid collectivization of our farms. Only under collective ownership can they truly be free from the capitalist's jackboot."

SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour:0 "노동의 군대화"
SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour_desc:0 "Man at its basis wants to avoid work, thus we will need to use state coercion as a necessary element to establish a society based around the interests of the interests of the labouring majority. Thus we will have to establish labour armies, we will also need to mobilize the proletariat to do tasks under military supervision, and we will need to fight labour deserters who want to sabotage the great revolution."

SOV_Proletarian_Revolution:0 "프롤레타리아 혁명"
SOV_Proletarian_Revolution_desc:0 "The revolution must be complete and all-encompassing. For socialism to be achieved we must put all our efforts towards its accomplishment and radically change society from top to bottom.

SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan:0 "새로운 5개년개발계획"
SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan_desc:0 "The taxation of the peasantry and thus taking the surplus value of the peasants will allow for the productive forces to transition to socialism to be created, which is best done through a central planning agency creating plans which allow for rapid industrialization."

SOV_Industrial_Democracy:0 "산업민주주의"
SOV_Industrial_Democracy_desc:0 "Kollontai's vision for union control over the economy has succeeded in winning over a majority of comrades. Despite her noble ancestry, she has always been a fighter for more control of unions and thus workers over the economy, as unions are the best representation of the will of the proletariat."

SOV_Break_The_Smychka:0 "스미치카 혁파"
SOV_Break_The_Smychka_desc:0 "As a result of centuries of feudal and capitalist rule, Russia has few true peasants. It's therefore inconceivable that the farmer will be at the center of the revolution, albeit through no fault of their own. No, it's the worker and not the peasant that will be the vanguard of the revolution, and he should be elevated as such."

SOV_Create_the_VSR:0 "VSR 창설"
SOV_Create_the_VSR_desc:0 "By establishing the All-Russian Union of Producers (VSR - Vserossiyskiy Soyuz Rabochikh), the trade unions will be granted a far greater influence over labour and the economy as a whole. In the end, this will serve to strengthen the worker and the Union alike."

SOV_Separation_Of_Powers:0 "권력 분립"
SOV_Separation_Of_Powers_desc:0 "The interest of the unions have been ignored far too much, we will create a separation of power between the unions, the Soviets and the Communist Party, which will allow to represent the proletariat while also allowing for the effective defence against reactionaries."

SOV_Rebuild_the_Country_desc:0 "While recent years have seen some of the worst of it, the Russian lands have been ravaged by the scourges of war and tyranny for the entirety of our living memory.

SOV_Help_The_People:0 "인민들을 돕다"
SOV_Help_The_People_desc:0 "The Second Russian Civil War has devastated large swaths of the nation, it has also impoverished many people.

SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy:0 "행정망 재건"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "Kerensky's reign and its aftermath hardly improved matters from the times of the Tsars.

SOV_Allow_Small_Traders:0 "소규모 무역 허용"
SOV_Allow_Small_Traders_desc:0 "In order to allow for a smoother transition to a socialist economy, a limited amount of commerce will be permitted within non-essential sectors of the economy. After all, the common man operating a small store is not that far removed from the worker on a factory floor and equating him with an industrial baron would create needless harm to the masses."

SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan:0 "러시아 국가전기화위원회"
SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan_desc:0 "Electrification is a central part for communism. Lenin went so far as to state that 'Communism is Soviet government plus the electrification of the whole country.'

SOV_Mechanisation:0 "기계화"

SOV_Khozraschyot:0 "경제적 회계"
SOV_Khozraschyot_desc:0 "A socialist economy cannot be created overnight. One of the early transitional steps as outlined in the New Economic Policy of the Russian Socialist Republic will require that certain elements of the free market model are emulated for the time being, something that in the short term will see greater developments in light rather than heavy industries."

SOV_Promote_Industrialisation:0 "산업화를 촉진"
SOV_Promote_Industrialisation_desc:0 "We do not exist in a vacuum. In order to modernize our economy into a socialist model, we have to participate in the global market on some level and we will need a certain amount of capital to procure the machinery and knowledge needed. The best way of achieving this is to establish a series of state trusts that can finance these ventures while allowing our internal economy separated from international capitalism."

SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution:0 "혁명전파"

SOV_Into_The_Caucasus_desc:0 "Lost after the Weltkrieg, the Don-Kuban Union is a reactionary state run by Cossack warlords.

As long as they remain at large, these states pose an active threat to our revolution."

SOV_Secure_Central_Asia:0 "중앙아시아 확보"
SOV_Secure_Central_Asia_desc:0 "Formerly part of Russia, the central Asian plains have since fallen to despotic Khans and their militant hordes. To bring Russian leadership to these lands wouldn't just be an act of self-defence on our part, but also an act of liberation of the downtrodden that live under the yoke of these warlords."

SOV_The_Final_Battle:0 "최후의 결전"
SOV_The_Final_Battle_desc:0 "The treaty of Brest-Litovsk handed over millions of workers to the German industrialists on a silver platter and gave them Russia's most heavily industrialized lands on top of it. It's our duty to liberate the people of the East from the German yoke once and for all."

SOV_Enemy_In_The_East:0 "동쪽의 적"

SOV_The_War_Effort:0 "조직화된 전쟁"

SOV_Officer_Training_Academies_desc:0 "Our military academies are in many ways still a relic of the past, with most being from the time of the Tsar.
