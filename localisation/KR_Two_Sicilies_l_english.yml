### Events ###

sic.1.t:0 "1936년의 양시칠리아 왕국"
sic.1.d:0 "Following the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was created, combining the two old kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, which lasted until 1860 when Sardinia-Piedmont, aided by Garibaldi's partisans, united Italy under her rule. The South, which was always generally agricultural, suffered at the hands of the Savoyards, who did not care much for industrialising the south, and poverty became commonplace.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began Italy eventually chose the side of the Entente, much to her ruin. When the Austrians achieved victory against the Savoyards, they reformed the Kingdom into the Italian Federation, consisting of a number of pre-unification smaller states. Civil war soon convulsed the peninsula, and the Austrian, Federation, and White Republican forces barely held the Syndicalists at the Po and Abruzzo Line. During the war scare of 1927, Sardinia abandoned the Italian Federation, and the Two Sicilies soon followed, leaving the Council of the Federation to be staffed only by northern Italian delegates. The Council was adjourned in 1929 and had not been recalled since, effectively ending the institution. Unrest has recently begun to grow against the Sicilian lack of progress on reconquering the north, and a second Italian Civil War seems probable.\n\nSince the end of hostilities, the Kingdom has been mostly focused internally, the Christian Democrats, in power since 1921, trying to pursue the age-old dream of land reform in the South. The lack of progress on this front, however, caused the Christian Democrat supermajority to fail in 1927, though a democratic coalition has kept power since, and made some small movements toward land reform in Campania and Capua. The rise of the opposing 'Integralisti 'e Doje Sicilie' could signal a radical change in the Kingdom's politics, and only time will tell if they get to achieve their reactionary aims or if democracy will prevail."

The MVSN, or as they are informally called 'Camicie Nere' for their black shirts have been popping up throughout the kingdom, from Naples to Palermo. Supposedly led by Achille Starace, this paramilitary organisation is described as the muscle behind the Integralisti in the Kingdom, for they have been keeping watch during their rallies, as well as disrupting and breaking up rallies of the left. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially amongst the youth.\n\nThe Camicie Nere is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."

However, with the rise of the Far Right and the creation of the Integralist Paramilitary force, the Partito Liberale and the Partito Popolare Democratico have agreed to form a coalition. This liberal pact is dedicated to preserving and strengthening liberal values within the Kingdom.\n\nThe creation of this alliance, however, weakens the Social Conservative party, for in the past the Partito Librale tended to support the Partito Democratico Cristiano. For the liberals though there is hope that this new coalition will keep the torch of liberalism strong within the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies."

This disruption quickly turned into a bloody battle that left quite a few injured, and even worse a few fatalities on both sides. While the CGSL has forsworn syndicalism, the Camicie Nere have been lately decrying their members as agents to the Socialist Republic in the North.\n\nNow the outcome of this particular case must be decided. Are these members innocent, or do the words of the Camicie Nere hold merit and truth? Many conservatives are siding with the Camicie Nere, declaring that they are traitors to the Kingdom, while some of the Liberals claim that they are innocent."

sic.45.d:0 "In the Socialist Republic of Italy christian socialism was rather popular in the north. As we focus on de-syndicalising society, many politicians want to turn away from liberal philosophies, with many more conservative and far-right members declaring them to be anti-christian. However, some among the Partito Cristiano Democratico think that, by focusing on a moderate christian democracy, we can turn people away from the more radical nature of christian socialism. This policy is criticized for being just a ploy to increase their power in the north."

Their practice of state-enforced atheism involved imprisoning priests and nuns, closing and even destroying churches, and persecuting believers. However now that we have destroyed the vile syndicalists, churches are open once again. Throughout the north, Italians are happy to be able to worship once again, and many are thanking the Emperor for liberating them from the syndicalist tyranny."

However, the issue is that his two brothers dispute whom should be the heir as the current law states only men can inherit.\n\nNormally according to the laws of the land, the throne would go to Ferdinand's brother Prince Carlos and his descedants, however, Ferdinand's other brother, Prince Ranieri, disputes that claim citing the Act of Cannes of 1900, due to Carlos' marriage to the Spanish princess Mercedes that put him in line for the Spanish throne."
