VEN_essequibo_decisions_desc:0 "Ever since the Crisis of 1895, Venezuela and the British Empire (or what's left of it nowadays) dispute the region of Essequibo, currently part of British Guiana. Now that the Canadians and the West Indies Federation are distracted by their hopeless reconquest of Britain and that we have a powerful backer, we have an opportunity to press our legitimate claims on the region."
VEN_demand_essequibo:0 "Demand Essequibo"
VEN_demand_essequibo_desc:0 "With the Anglos distracted, we have the chance of a lifetime to reclaim our lost lands west of the Essequibo River."

VEN_GCL_decisions:0 "The Bolivarian Dream"
VEN_GCL_decisions_desc:0 "Since we have liberated Colombia from its unlawful regime and with our army occupying it, we have a chance to revive Simón Bolívar's legacy: Gran Colombia. While the former Republic of Colombia that previously ecompassed modern Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama failed over a century ago and there is serious resistance to our occupation, our leadership is willing to spend serious effort in fostering and reviving grancolombiano unity."
VEN_secure_bogota:0 "Securing Bogotá"
VEN_secure_bogota_desc:0 "Bogotá was the capital of Gran Colombia when it was unified in the 19th century. At the centre of the union, it is imperative that we secure the city to legitimise our rule."

VEN_secure_meta:0 "Securing Meta"

VEN_secure_choco:0 "Securing Chocó"
VEN_secure_choco_desc:0 "Colombia's Pacific coast is a very diverse region, with the nortern half mostly tropical. It will be difficult, but essential, to secure."
VEN_secure_cauca:0 "Securing Cauca"
VEN_secure_cauca_desc:0 "The southern half of the Pacific region, mainly the Department of Cauca, is dominated by the Andes, and we all know how easy it is to hide in them."

VEN_oil_decisions:0 "Dealing with the Foreign Oil Companies"
VEN_oil_decisions_desc:0 "The vast majority of Venezuela's petroleum industry is in the hands of foreign companies such as Shell and the successors of Standard Oil. Their influence in the country is vast and is both good and detrimental to our economy, but we might be able to limit the negatives by acquiring a greater share in those companies... Or, we could simply seize them should the opportunity present itself."
VEN_oil_USA_buy:0 "Shares in US Oil Companies"
VEN_oil_USA_buy_desc:0 "Yanqui companies such as the different successors to the massive Standard Oil company and Texaco control vast amounts of our nation's oil fields and production centres. Acquiring a greater share of those companies will be an expensive endeavour that will hopefully profit us in the long run and reduce their influence in Venezuela."
VEN_oil_USA_seize:0 "Seize Yanqui Assets!"
VEN_oil_USA_seize_desc:0 "Now that the Yanqui are busy shooting at each other for idiotic reasons, we have a great opportunity to... acquire a number of assets owned by American oil companies should they refuse to play by our new rules. This will surely anger the USA, but what can they do?"
VEN_oil_HOL_buy:0 "Shares in local Shell Assets"
VEN_oil_HOL_buy_desc:0 "Royal Dutch Shell was one of the first companies to acquire consessions in Venezuela. Now that our economy can sustain such an operation, we can acquire a larger share of the so-called Shell de Venezuela, reducing the power of the Dutch company in the country."
VEN_oil_HOL_seize:0 "Seize Shell Assets!"
VEN_oil_HOL_seize_desc:0 "With a syndicalist revolution underway in the Netherlands, we have a chance to seize Shell's assets in the country and reduce their power and influence in Venezuela. The Dutch certainly can't stop us now."

### Focuses ###
VEN_blackmonday:0 "검은 월요일의 유정 지대 강타"
VEN_blackmonday_desc:0 "하느님 맙소사! 우리 대외무역의 대다수는 독일과 함께 하고 있기 때문에, 그들의 경제 위기는 우리에게 다가올 수밖에 없었습니다. 현재, 카라카스 사람들 사이에 공황이 퍼지고 있으니 우리는 즉각적으로 현재 문제들을 처리해야 합니다."

VEN_democracy_prevails:0 "민주주의가 우세하다"
VEN_democracy_prevails_desc:0 "베네수엘라 전역의 도시들에 평온함이 다시 찾아왔습니다. 특히나 노동자들이 계속되는 위기로 인해 상당히 큰 타격을 받았기 때문에, 우리는 경제 회복의 길에 집중해야만 합니다."
VEN_welfare_program:0 "복지 프로그램"
VEN_welfare_program_desc:0 "국민이 가장 필요로 할 때 복지를 삭감하는 것은 실수일 것입니다. 현실적으로, 우리는 우리의 복지 프로그램이 국민들이 어려울 때 가능한 한 많은 베네수엘라 국민들에게 도달할 수 있도록 보장해야 합니다."
VEN_healthcare_education:0 "의료 및 교육 확장"
VEN_healthcare_education_desc:0 "의료와 교육은 국가가 제공하는 가장 기본적이고 필요한 기관이며 우리는 이것들이 국민들에게 다가갈 수 있도록 보장해야 합니다. 우리 국민이 건강하고 교육받은 상태를 유지하도록 하는 것은 미래 세대를 위해 우리가 할 수 있는 최선의 일입니다. 왜냐하면 이런 어려운 시기에도 의료와 교육의 장기적인 혜택은 분명하기 때문입니다."
VEN_expand_pensions:0 "연금 제도 확장"
VEN_expand_pensions_desc:0 "노약자나 장애인 등 일할 수 없는 사람들은 재난 때 가장 취약합니다. 따라서, 안정성을 유지하고 사람들을 행복하게 하기 위해서는, 더 많은 가난한 베네수엘라 사람들이 접근할 수 있도록 연금 제도를 확대해야 합니다."
VEN_indreseach:0 "산업 투자"
VEN_indreseach_desc:0 "위기에서 회복하고 석유 산업에 대한 우리의 의존도를 줄이는 중요한 단계로서, 국가는 다른 산업 부문에 투자하여 산업의 성장과 더 많은 사람들을 고용할 수 있는 능력을 보장할 필요가 있습니다."
VEN_flexibilty:0 "경제의 유연성"
VEN_flexibilty_desc:0 "현재의 위기는 석유 산업에 계속 의존할 수 없다는 것을 보여줍니다. 그런 만큼 우리 경제를 좀 더 유연화하고 다변화해서 변화하는 세계 경제에 적응할 수 있도록 해야 합니다. 바라건대, 이것으로 우리 경제가 더 튼튼해지고 경제 변화에 보다 탄력적으로 만들어지길 바랍니다."
VEN_diversification2:0 "산업 다양화"
VEN_diversification2_desc:0 "우리 산업을 다양화하는 것은 비용이 많이 들고 느린 과정이지만 베네수엘라 경제가 시장 변동으로부터 안전하고 건강한 속도로 계속 성장할 수 있도록 보장할 것입니다. 이러한 과정의 비용과 속도에도 불구하고, 이것은 장기적으로 베네수엘라를 석유에 대한 의존을 지속시키는 것보다 훨씬 더 강하게 만들 것입니다."

VEN_preventive_coup:0 "예방적인 쿠데타"
VEN_preventive_coup_desc:0 "민주운동당 정부가 질서를 유지할 수 없는 상황에서 베네수엘라 군대가 개입해 질서를 회복하고 경제를 회복으로 이끌었습니다. 물론 임시정부는 1939년에 예정된 선거는 정상적으로 진행될 것이라고 주장하고 있기 때문에 이것은 일시적일 것입니다."
VEN_defensecontracts:0 "방위 계약"
VEN_defensecontracts_desc:0 "경제를 돕기 위한 방편으로, 정부는 군에 물품을 공급하기 위한 더 많은 계약을 발행하고 있습니다. 이를 통해 고군분투하고 있는 소규모 제조 부문이 회복되고 성장할 수 있도록 지원됨으로써 베네수엘라 국민을 더 많이 고용하고 풍요롭게 하는 동시에 군대가 잘 갖추어지고 영향력 있는 국가로 남게 될 것입니다."
VEN_diversification1:0 "무기 산업 확장"
VEN_diversification1_desc:0 "베네수엘라의 군사 산업은 솔직히 말하자면 아주 작습니다. 특히 군 규모에 비하면 말입니다. 무기와 탄약과 같은 군수품에 대한 수요는 인위적일 수 있지만, 이것은 사람들로 하여금 일을 하게 하고, 돈을 지불하게 하고, 구매하게 합니다. 게다가, 군대가 잘 갖추어지도록 하는 것은 1925년에 그들의 형편없는 쇼를 반복하는 것을 피하는 데 도움이 될 것입니다."
VEN_diversification3:0 "군수품 자급자족"
VEN_diversification3_desc:0 "우리의 무기 의존도가 낮을수록 수입은 더 좋습니다. 특히 세계정세가 걷잡을 수없이 소용돌이 속에 휘말려 들어가면서 더욱 그렇습니다. 수입을 계속할 수 없을 수도 있기 때문에, 우리는 지역 군사 산업을 확장하고 수입을 대체하는 것이 나을 것입니다."
VEN_cut_welfare:0 "복리후생 제거"
VEN_cut_welfare_desc:0 "경제가 난장판인 상황에서 우리는 허리띠를 졸라매고 지출을 줄여야 합니다. 앞선 정부가 제정한 복지 프로그램은 불안정한 우리 재정에 큰 부담이 되어 우리를 빚더미에 앉히고 있습니다. 예산 균형을 맞추기 위해 프로그램을 종료해야 합니다."
VEN_arrest_syndie_troublemakers:0 "생디칼리스트 선동꾼 체포"
VEN_arrest_syndie_troublemakers_desc:0 "잠재적인 생디칼리스트 혁명의 위험성은 검은 월요일 이후에 군대가 개입하게 된 이유입니다. 임시정부가 확보된 상황에서 군대는 베네수엘라에서 생디칼운동의 핵심 구성원을 체포하고 그들의 정치 영향력을 약화시킬 수 있는 능력을 갖추게 되었습니다."
VEN_propagandaeffort:0 "선전 노력"
VEN_propagandaeffort_desc:0 "우리의 쿠데타가 전례가 없는 것은 아니지만, 정치적인 반대파들, 특히 이전에 정부에 있던 사람들은 민주적 제도의 부식에 지치도록 만들었습니다. 국민들에게 우리 임시정부의 일시적인 성격을 이해시키고 예정된 선거가 유지되도록 해야 합니다."

VEN_inf:0 "비상 사회 기반 시설 작업"
VEN_inf_desc:0 "사람들을 다시 일터로 복귀시키기 위한 임시 대책으로, 정부는 사회 기반 시설 작업 계획에 착수했습니다. 이렇게 되면 실업자에게 유급 직업만 줄 뿐 아니라 베네수엘라의 사회 기반 시설 네트워크를 개선하여 베네수엘라를 더욱 가깝게 만들 수 있습니다."
VEN_milinf:0 "공항 건설 노력"
VEN_milinf_desc:0 "세계대전 이후 항공 운송이 더욱 확산되었습니다. 하지만, 우리의 항공 기반 시설은 매우 부족하며 이것을 개선하면 우리 공군의 발전에 도움이 될 것이고, 더 고립된 지역에 대한 접근을 향상시킬 것입니다."
VEN_inf2:0 "사회 기반 시설 갱신"
VEN_inf2_desc:0 "경제가 확실히 회복되고 있지만, 아직도 우리나라의 교통망을 개선하기 위해 우리가 할 수 있는 일이 훨씬 더 많습니다. 결국, 좋은 사회 기반 시설은 건강한 경제 발전의 열쇠입니다."

VEN_healthyeco:0 "경제 회복"
VEN_healthyeco_desc:0 "베네수엘라가 드디어 경제 위기에서 회복했습니다. 나라를 다시 번창하게 하기 위해서는 아직 훨씬 더 많은 조치가 남아 있지만, 분명히 최악의 위기 상황은 지나갔습니다. 이제 우리는 경제를 성장시키고 번영하는 베네수엘라를 만드는데 관심을 집중할 수 있습니다."

VEN_1939_elections:0 "1939년 선거"

While we obviously will have to say goodbye to part of our arms stockpile, it would be a rather lucrative contract that would stimulate our arms industry."
ven.7.a:0 "Sounds like a good deal!"
ven.7.b:0 "We can't spare any arms."
ven.8.t:0 "Small Arms Shipment"
ven.8.d:0 "We have successfully acquired a sizeable shipment of small arms to outfit our troops or hold in reserve. Our soldiers will have no issue using them as they are similar or the same as what they are used to. Now, of course, we have to pay for the guns."
ven.8.a:0 "Excellent"
ven.10.t:0 "The Venezuelan Oil Industry"
ven.10.d:0 "Oil has always been a chief export of Venezuela, as far back as we can remember. It has been proposed that we take the Oil Industry from the hands of foreign companies and sell the oil to them ourselves. Our profits would increase and we would have taken another step towards true independence and self dependence."
ven.10.a:0 "The Oil Refined Here is Ours, Nationalise!"
ven.10.b:0 "We would not want to upset foreign interests"
ven.11.t:0 "검은 월요일이 유정 지대를 강타하다!"
ven.11.d:0 "베네수엘라 경제는 우리의 풍부한 유정 발견 이후 황금기를 맞고 있습니다. 유럽, 미국, 일본의 굶주린 산업들은 오랫동안 그들이 감당할 수 있는 모든 석유를 구입했습니다. 하지만, 검은 월요일의 강타 이후, 상황은 놀랄 만큼 빠르게 휘어지기 시작했습니다. 유가가 폭락했고, 국가 수입도 급감했습니다. 곧 기본적인 서비스 제공에도 어려움을 겪게 될 것이므로, [Root.GetLeader] 대통령은 너무 늦기 전에 조치를 취해야 합니다."
ven.11.a:0 "대재앙이로군!"
ven.12.t:0 "Importing Artillery"
ven.12.d.a:0 "Because of the limited size of our arms industry, heavy weapons and equipment such as artillery pieces are difficult to come by. Until our military industry is up to date, we must import them. Two major producers come to mind: Krupp in Germany and Škoda in Bohemia. Both of these companies offer the quantity of big guns we need at a price we can afford and have the best reputation."
ven.12.d.b:0 "It appears that our first choice is unable to supply us with the quantity of artillery pieces we requested. Thankfully, we have a second option who are hopefully able and willing to sell us much-needed guns to the Venezuelan Army."
ven.12.d.c:0 "Clearly, these foreign companies are not to be trusted as we feared. We will have to make due with local arms production or acquire them in some other way."
ven.12.a:0 "Ask Krupp."
ven.12.b:0 "Ask Škoda."
ven.12.c:0 "We couldn't trust them after all."
ven.13.t:0 "Exporting Arms to Venezuela?"
ven.13.d:0 "We have been approached by an officer from the Venezuelan military looking to buy a modest amount of artillery pieces to refit their troops.

ven.14.t:0 "Artillery Shipment"
ven.14.d:0 "We have successfully acquired a sizeable shipment of field guns to outfit our troops or hold in reserve. These will give us a much-needed boost in firepower. Now, of course, we have to pay for the guns."
ven.14.a:0 "Excellent"
ven.15.t:0 "Acquiring Surplus Fighters"
ven.15.d.a:0 "The aviation industry in Venezuela is practically non-existent, but aircraft have been already proven to be an integral part of modern warfare. The Germans and the Americans, is stability has returned there, should have enough surplus aircraft to sell to us at a cheap price, letting us outfit our nascent air force and study their designs."
ven.15.d.b:0 "Our first choice for surplus aircraft is unable to provide us with the equipment we requested. Thankfully, we have an alternative to fall back to and we can only hope that they will prove more willing than the first."
ven.15.d.c:0 "It appears that we have ran out of options as the main players in the aeronautics industry are either unavailable to us or unwilling to spare us surplus aircraft. We will have to figure out another way to get new aircraft for our air force and to jump-start out own industry with limited help."
ven.15.d.d:0 "The aviation industry in Venezuela is practically non-existent, but aircraft have been already proven to be an integral part of modern warfare. Our French comrades may be able to supply us with some aircrafts to help us build up our air force."
ven.15.a:0 "Ask a German company."
ven.15.b:0 "Ask an American company."
ven.15.c:0 "We couldn't trust them after all."

ven.17.a:0 "Excellent"
ven.18.t:0 "Importing Small Arms"
ven.18.d.a:0 "Because of how limited our domestic arms industry is, we are still reliant on foreign producers. However, our main suppliers are unwilling to sell us arms because of our revolutionary government. Thankfully, our Comrades in France and Britain should be able to help us with our small arms deficit."
ven.18.d.b:0 "It appears that our first choice is unable to supply us with the quantity of firearms we requested. Thankfully, we have a second option who are hopefully able and willing to trade us much-needed rifles to the Venezuelan Army."
ven.18.d.c:0 "Clearly, these foreign companies are not to be trusted as we feared. We will have to make due with local arms production or acquire them in some other way."

ven.19.d.a:0 "Because of the limited size of our arms industry, heavy weapons and equipment such as artillery pieces are difficult to come by.

ven.20.t:0 "Acquiring Surplus Fighters"
ven.20.d.a:0 "The aviation industry in Venezuela is practically non-existent, but aircraft have been already proven to be an integral part of modern warfare. Our French and British comrades, or even the revolutionaries in America, may be able to supply us with some aircrafts to help us build up our air force."

ven.21.d:0 "It is no secret that since General Pérez Jiménez's coup that Venezuela is aligned with the USA. Now that the former has formalised the League of American States, we can join this alliance and formalise our close ties with the United States of America."
ven.21.a:0 "The USA is our greatest ally."
ven.22.t:0 "Opposition Organises in Venezuela"
ven.22.d:0 "Last week, an armory was raided and hundreds of weapons stolen. Unsurprisingly, today, we received news that opponents to our government have been organising under the safety of Venezuela's reactionary regime. While we have no proof, we suspect that these disgruntled traitors are responsible for stealing Colombian Army rifles and smuggling them to Venezuela, preparing an insurrection."
ven.22.a:0 "We must stay vigilant."
ven.23.t:0 "Venezuela Prepares for War"
ven.23.d:0 "As we suspected, the reactionary Venezuelans have been preparing to overthrow our government. Not only have they been arming Colombian traitors in their country, but we have received intelligence reports that they are mobilising their forces and preparing to invade us."
ven.23.a:0 "They won't take an inch of Colombian land."
ven.24.t:0 "Venezuela Demands Essequibo"
ven.24.d:0 "The damned vultures in Venezuela have taken advantage of our fight to liberate Britain to make territorial demands on the West Indies Federation. They have claimed the region west of the Essequibo River in Guyana since 1895 when we were awarded the region through international arbitration, which they have contested ever since. While we can hardly spare men to defend the isolated, useless jungles of Guyana and the Venezuelans do have a powerful foreign backer, surrendering even an inch of Imperial territory to these vultures would bring us unbearable shame."
ven.24.a:0 "We will fight them in the jungles."
ven.25.t:0 "Anglos Refuse our Ultimatum"
ven.25.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the perfidious, stubborn imperialists in Canada have refused to cede Guyana Esequiba. It appears that we will have to retake it by force with the help of our benefactors."
ven.25.a:0 "We shall retake our rightful lands!"
ven.26.t:0 "Colombian Volunteers Return Home"
ven.26.d:0 "With their homeland liberated, the volunteers we armed to ovethrow the oppressive syndicalist regime in Colombia have been disbanded and they have returned home, decorated and honoured."
ven.26.a:0 "Their service will be remembered."
ven.27.t:0 "Venezuela Purchases Shares in our Oil Industry"
ven.27.d:0 "Our petroleum industry controls a huge portion of Venezuela's oil. In an attempt to acquire a larger portion of the profits generated by their resources, the Venezuelan government has bought a larger share of our oil assets in their country."
ven.27.a:0 "Such is the Free Market"
ven.28.t:0 "Venezuela Seizes our Oil Assets"
ven.28.d:0 "As we are unable to protect our assets oversears, the Venezuelan government has taken advantage of our precarious situation and has seized our oil assets in their country. While this is a loss for [Root.GetAdjective] companies, there is nothing we can do to stop them."

ven.29.d:0 "As our constitution dictates, five years have elapsed since the last election and it is time for a new one.
