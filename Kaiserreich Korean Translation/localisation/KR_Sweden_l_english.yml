SWE_statare_idea:0 "스타타레"
SWE_statare_idea_desc:0 "스타타레는 스웨덴 사회에서 최하위 계층인 연간계약직 노동자들입니다. 이들은 돈 대신에 음식으로 값을 지불하고 있으며, 이들은 전근대시대의 유물로서 계속해서 존재하게 되었고, 이들의 열악한 환경은 다소 국가적인 골칫거리가 되었습니다."
SWE_political_instability_idea:0 "정치적 불안정"
SWE_political_instability_idea_desc:0 "인기 있는 총리인 아비드 린드만(Arvid Lindman)이 은퇴하고, 그닥 카리스마 없는 괴스타 바게(Gösta Bagge)가 자리를 이어받게 되어, 야당 당수인 페르 알빈 한손이 더 선거에서 유력해보이는 반면, 총선연맹은 유권자들의 마음을 사지 못 하고 있습니다. 물론 당연히 모든 사람들이 사회민주주의의 선거승리 전망에 대해 기대하고 있는 것은 아닙니다."

SWE_radicalisteconomy_desc:0 "현 경제 체제는 주로 시민의 생활 수준을 보장하기 위해 연계되어 있습니다. 지역 공산주의자들은 적합하다고 판단하는 대로 예산을 조정할 수 있는 자유가 약간 있지만 대부분은 중앙 정부에서 통제합니다."
SWE_radicalistsociety:0 "급진사회주의 정치"
SWE_radicalistsociety_desc:0 "우리 사회주의 사회에서 인민은 자신들의 이익을 대변하는 강력한 연대체제를 조직합니다. 인민이 조직에 영향을 줄 수 있는 기회는 스스로를 중요한 존재로 인식할 정도로 충분합니다."

SWE_totalisteconomy:0 "전체주의 경제"

SWE_syndicalisteconomy:0 "생디칼리스트 경제"
SWE_syndicalisteconomy_desc:0 "우리 경제 체제는 매우 자율적이며, 규모에 관계없이 지역 공동체를 강화하도록 설계되어 있습니다. 지역마다 권력을 집중시켜서, 각 지역을 잘 아는 자의 손에 전권을 맡겨 두었습니다."

### Focuses ###

SWE_issues_at_hand:0 "당면한 문제"
SWE_issues_at_hand_desc:0 "유럽의 다른 국가들에 비해 상대적으로 번영을 누리고 있는 반면, 국민들은 여전히 만족하지 못 하고 있습니다. 우리는 국가로서 우리가 당면한 경제적, 사회적인 문제들을 무시할 수 없습니다. 임기가 끝나면, 재선을 모색하며 스웨덴 국민들을 위해 할 수 있는 모든 것을 다 했다는 것을 확신시켜주어야 합니다."
SWE_reassure_big_businesses:0 "대기업 지원"
SWE_reassure_big_businesses_desc:0 "우리는 기업들에 대한 지속적인 지원을 보장해주어야 합니다. 대기업들은 스웨덴 경제의 필수적인 초석이므로, 우리가 대기업들의 편이라는 것을 확신시켜줘야 하며, 무의미한 규제로 대기업들을 방해할 생각은 하지 말아야 합니다. 그들의 충성심에 대한 보답은 기업에 대한 몇 가지 투자로 충분할 것입니다."
SWE_adress_peoples_pleas:0 "인민의 연설"
SWE_adress_peoples_pleas_desc:0 "사회민주당은 독점권을 지닌 자선단체가 아닙니다! 우리는 특히 경기 침체와 다가오는 선거가 복잡하게 짜여진 사회 구조를 분열시키려 함에 따라, 국민생활 향상을 위해 우리의 입장을 이용해야 합니다. 우리는 국민의 안전과 행복을 보장해야 합니다."
SWE_agricultural_reforms:0 "농업 개혁"
SWE_agricultural_reforms_desc:0 "스웨덴 현대화를 추진해 나감에 따라 뒤처지는 이가 없도록 해야 합니다. 도시 산업을 육성하는 것이 필수적이라 라더라도 시골 농장과 마을을 무시해서는 안됩니다. 저들을 돕기 위해 법적 노력과 동시에 투자도 이루어질 것입니다!"
SWE_elections_at_last:0 "마침내 선거 일이 되다!"
SWE_elections_at_last_desc:0 "스웨덴은 민주주의 국가이며, 앞으로도 그럴 것입니다! 선거는 예정된 대로 치러질 것이며, 많은 사람들은 이번 선거가 현 보수주의 정권과 사회민주주의를 대표하는 사회민주노동당 사이의 논쟁 아래 치러질 것으로 예상합니다."
SWE_opposition_victory:0 "야당의 승리"
SWE_opposition_victory_desc:0 "덴마크에서와 같이 스웨덴에서도 사회민주주의가 승리했습니다! 오랜 기간 계속되었던 보수 정권은 경제적, 사회적 불평등을 해소하지 못했습니다. 정부는 더 이상 대기업보다는 국민을 대표할 것입니다. 사회민주노동당 정권은 아직 갈 길이 멀지만, 보다 번영하는 미래로 향하는 첫 걸음이라는 의미가 있습니다."
SWE_forced_abdication:0 "강제 퇴위"
SWE_forced_abdication_desc:0 "우리가 정권을 잡을 수 있었던 이유는 사회주의를 표방하는 사회민주좌파당의 지지 덕분이었습니다. 선거 이전에 그들이 강하게 주장했던 사항은 스웨덴 왕정 폐지였습니다. 한 인간이 선거에서 당선되지 않고 단지 출생 성분으로 인해 권력을 가진다는 건 말도 안되는 일입니다. 우리는 사회민주좌파당에 보답하기 위해 스웨덴에서 군주제를 제거해야 합니다. 그러나 많은 보수주의자들이 국왕에게 충성을 맹세하였으므로, 폐지를 강력히 반대할 수 있기 때문에 이 문제에 조심스럽게 접근해야 합니다."
SWE_coalition_of_likeminded:0 "동지끼리의 연합"
SWE_coalition_of_likeminded_desc:0 "The social democrats did not win the election on our own. Our coalition and compromise helped us secure a majority. We must take advantage of our ideological diversity!"
SWE_public_healthcare:0 "공공 의료"
SWE_public_healthcare_desc:0 "One of the worst offenses of the previous government was keeping health care in the hands of private companies. Companies that care about making a profit over keeping people happy, healthy and alive. We seek to mitigate this, by leaving healthcare to the government, which is not blinded by absurd motives like making profit."
SWE_education_reforms:0 "교육 개혁"
SWE_education_reforms_desc:0 "The Swedish education system has been long since neglected by the conservatives, and requires intervention! We must ensure widespread literacy and education, and will settle for nothing less!"
SWE_equal_society:0 "평등한 사회!"
SWE_equal_society_desc:0 "The reforms of the SAP has transformed Sweden from a hierarchical society where the power rests in the hands of the few, into one where all men and women are truly equal. Fairness and equal opportunity are now important parts of the Swedish identity!"
SWE_folkhemmet:0 "인민의 집"
SWE_folkhemmet_desc:0 "The SAP's ideal of Folkhemmet has now been applied nationwide! Sweden has now become the good home for its people it always should have been. The reforms of the SAP have mitigated the inequalities of a previously flawed system, into one where nobody is neglected by the government."
SWE_conservative_victory:0 "보수당의 승리"
SWE_conservative_victory_desc:0 "Thankfully, the Swedish conservatives have maintained our power, and averted the disaster that would have been caused by the SAP. It's clear the people did not want Sweden to go the way of Britain or France, and have renewed their faith in conservativism. Now we can continue to take advantage of the market, and improve the quality of life of our citizens, without resorting to dangerous ideals of Syndicalism."
SWE_free_trade_economy:0 "자유 무역 경제"
SWE_free_trade_economy_desc:0 "It is time we wise up and realize that tariffs hurt far more than they help. Many nations would like to buy some of the vast amount of resources we have, and it is best that we stay out of this process with pointless protectionism."
SWE_abolish_statare:0 "스타타레 폐지"
SWE_abolish_statare_desc:0 "Statare is by no means a popular or proud program existing in Sweden. The conditions of those under it are less than ideal. We should use our position of power to formally abolish it. We predict it will not be missed."
SWE_basis_of_democracy:0 "민주주의의 기초"
SWE_basis_of_democracy_desc:0 "The people have spoken and we have answered! These elections have been fraught with worry between the rising tensions from both the right and the left. Nevertheless, we have managed the walk the narrow line and keep our democratic traditions pure that have served our nation so well in the past."
SWE_temporary_military_government:0 "임시 군사 정부"
SWE_temporary_military_government_desc:0 "Disaster has been avoided! In our darkest hour, the military has stepped in and prevented the brutal transformation of our government into a syndicalist hellhole. Before the military relinquishes power, we must ensure the stability of our nation. We are not despots!"
SWE_return_of_the_king:0 "왕의 귀환?"
SWE_return_of_the_king_desc:0 "The SAP's foolish abolition of the monarchy is what laid the course for the military intervention. We must fulfil our original mission to restore the monarchy. On the other hand, some of the more hardline members of the military propose that we do away with the restoration, and instead move towards direct military rule."
SWE_a_new_king:0 "새로운 국왕"
SWE_a_new_king_desc:0 "It was clear that by letting the socialists come to power, Gustav V has shown us all his failure to lead Sweden. As for the new king, his grandson shall suffice, and will hopefully never make a mistake on the magnitude of his father's."
SWE_stabilize_the_nation:0 "국가 안정화"
SWE_stabilize_the_nation_desc:0 "As things are more or less returning to normal, we must use our last measures to combat the widespread instability we face."
SWE_protectionist_economy:0 "보호주의 경제"
SWE_protectionist_economy_desc:0 "Sweden has vast access to coveted resources, neccesary for building ships, infrastructure and all other great things. If other nations seek to use our mineral wealth, we must make sure tariffs are placed to ensure our safety and profit. Foreign nations will not be able to run amok, taking what they want!"
SWE_swedish_red_scare:0 "스웨덴의 붉은 공포"
SWE_swedish_red_scare_desc:0 "We have narrowly avoided going the way of France and Britain, but the threat is not gone. In fact, now more than ever we must ensure that socialism doesn't spread to our nation like a plague. We must remind the people what a socialist Sweden would truly look like. Breadlines, godlessness, economic ruin, collapse of the social order! We cannot afford for this to become our reality."
SWE_unity_under_god:0 "하나님아래 단결"
SWE_unity_under_god_desc:0 "For nearly a millenium, Christianity has been the dominant religion in Sweden, and for good reason. The lord brought his wisdom upon the Earth, and instilled values of kindness, generosity and piety amongst the people. In this present crisis, we cannot forget these values, and must have a government truly ordained by God!"
SWE_new_constitution:0 "새로운 헌법"
SWE_new_constitution_desc:0 "The old Swedish constitution had its fair share of flaws, so there are proposals to draft a new one. One that prioritizes Sweden first, and doesn't go too far in providing freedoms. Stability is the most important thing a the moment."
SWE_big_business_sponsorship:0 "대기업 후원"
SWE_big_business_sponsorship_desc:0 "While the social democrats flirt with nearly syndicalist policies, we are free to enjoy the benefits of free market capitalism. The corporations responsible for our success as a nation should endorse our leadership."
SWE_corporatize_statare:0 "스타타레 기업화"
SWE_corporatize_statare_desc:0 "Statare is a problematic system, but instead of removing it entirely like some suggest, we should place it under the perview of corporations. This is a surefire way to improve those working under it."
SWE_permanent_military_government:0 "영구 군사 정부"
SWE_permanent_military_government_desc:0 "While our intention at first was to place Swedish power back into the hands of the monarchy, we cannot let this happen. The monarchy refused to step in at the hour of our need and overthrow the social democrats, we did that for them! We can ensure our continuous stability by making military rule permanent."
SWE_military_crackdowns:0 "군의 강력 탄압"
SWE_military_crackdowns_desc:0 "The country is filled with insubordination! Many protest the temporary military government, but we can use our position of power to crackdown on the more unsavory protesters."
SWE_loyalty_to_the_flag:0 "국기에 대한 충성심"
SWE_loyalty_to_the_flag_desc:0 "For 500 years, the beautiful blue and yellow cross of Sweden has inspired millions and placed faith in our country and values. It should bring tears to the eyes of the average Swedish citizen. The people should stand for the flag as much as the flag stands for them. As well as there should be undying loyalty to the state, there shall be undying loyalty to the flag!"
SWE_ehrensvard_cabinet:0 "에렌스베르트 내각"
SWE_ehrensvard_cabinet_desc:0 "Taking permanent military power is general Carl August Ehrensvärd. His power is being taken as a preventative measure against the more hardline military faction turning Sweden into an even more extreme stratocracy. He will co rule with his brother, Gösta Ehrensvärd, and is expected to make concessions to the Swedish people who are still pro democracy."
SWE_swedish_thaw:0 "스웨덴 해동"
SWE_swedish_thaw_desc:0 "We cannot ignore the influence democracy still holds in Sweden. We must dissuade the extremists and ensure the support of democratic forces. We did not rescue Sweden from one disaster just to become another!"
SWE_balancing_act:0 "균형 유지 법"
SWE_balancing_act_desc:0 "We find ourselves in a difficult situation. We must appease both conservative militarists who led to our rise to power and average republicans, who make up the majority of the Swedish population. If we manage to succeed, we will be in a very comfortable position."
SWE_jung_junta:0 "융 군부"
SWE_jung_junta_desc:0 "Helge Jung was content working under a democratic system, but it's failure to safeguard the monarchy and capitalism made him play his hand. He is an open supporter of military rearmament, who has a decent sized base of support."
SWE_extend_martial_law:0 "계엄령 연장"
SWE_extend_martial_law_desc:0 "The advantages of martial law are very apparent to us. There is no greater way to ensure stability, but we can also take it a step futher. Just as the military guards the streets of Stockholm, it should guard the streets of every town!"
SWE_military_industry:0 "군사 산업"
SWE_military_industry_desc:0 "As a nation ruled by the military, we must make large strides to ensure that it thrives. Factories shall be constructed that make weapons to contribute to the war effort!"
SWE_gyllenkrok_regime:0 "길렌크로크 정권"
SWE_gyllenkrok_regime_desc:0 "By far the least likely of the three military leaders has come to power, Axel Gyllenkrok.  He is known to be agressive, rude, sarcastic and almost abusive to his subordinates. An intelligent man, and a proponent of aircraft and military budget, he will ensure that the Swedish military will thrive."
SWE_domestic_threats:0 "국내 위협"
SWE_domestic_threats_desc:0 "Our young military regime is by no means invincible. People who seek to undermine it are everywhere, and we must be sure this rebellion is extinguished!"
SWE_military_work_batallions:0 "Military Work Batallions"
SWE_military_work_batallions_desc:0 "There shall be no such thing as a useless citizen. We can ensure loyalty to the military state as well as construction improvement by drafting civilians that do non-combat jobs to put their labor to use by building."
SWE_stapol:0 "STAPOL"

swe.33.t:0 "노동조합"
swe.33.d:0 "After the government decreed that everyone partake in the unions, they were suddenly packed with uninterested workers who reluctantly attended the union meetings. The legitimacy remained low, but with a lot of government pushing participation started to rise and after some time, some concessions convinced some more workers that there was merit in this system. As a result the controlled union system has become somewhat of a self-sustaining organism but it is probably still not what the Riksledare and the ideologues intended it to be."
swe.33.a:0 "탄압만이 대성공이라고 전해라!"

swe.34.t:0 "A Riksledare and an Archbishop"
swe.34.d:0 "The SRNS recognized the moral authority held over the Swedish people by the church of Sweden. In fact, gaining the support of this body was one reason the small Swedish Jewish community had seen protection by the Riksledare from the less racially inclusive elements in his cabinet, as the archbishop was known to oppose antisemitism. Because of these reasons, it was no surprise that Axel Gyllenkrok and the archbishop of Uppsala, Erling Eidem met regularly. Gyllenkrok was willing to pass substantial laws favouring the church of Sweden, for instance to restore the legislation that rendered it illegal to leave the church as well as cracking down on sinful activities. In return however, the church would have to actively remove progressive anti-government clergy and openly support the Riksledare. Based on his conversation with the Riksledare, Erling called a synod to discuss the issue."
swe.34.a:0 "Let the synod run its course..."
swe.34.b:0 "Help the decision-making by visiting anti-government clergy."

swe.35.t:0 "The Synod of Uppsala"
swe.35.d:0 "The synod of the church of Sweden has concluded and the priests have agreed that no earthly government the likes of that of the SRNS can have unequivocal support, and that in this light the democracy that existed before suffered from a lesser moral deficit. In addition, they agreed one can't bargain for God's support with legislation in support of His values. People need to open their hearts for it themselves after all. The clear outcome of the synod is a rejection of the SRNS doctrine.\nThe Riksledare ignited in outrage by the news and by the end of the day the Church of Sweden was neither the state church anymore, nor could many priests of the organisation, including archbishop Erling enjoy their freedom anymore."
swe.35.a:0 "B-but wroth is a sin?"

swe.36.t:0 "The Synod of Uppsala"
swe.36.d:0 "Strangely, many progressive clergymen did not arrive at the synod or suddenly changed their minds on the matter. However, the synod went ahead as planned: The clergymen that were actually present agreed that the execution of God's will was worth some concessions and that SRNS government was already carrying out God's will by persecuting heathenly syndicalists and protecting Sweden from this scourge.\nThe Riksledare was delighted by the news and from that point on the church of Sweden became a integral if at times somewhat reluctant part of the SRNS propaganda machine, with a topdown enforcement of orthodox government support and heavy government support for the church in return."
swe.36.a:0 "We shall hold our end of the bargain too!"

swe.37.t:0 "Transition to a civil government"
swe.37.d:0 "As time passed on, the military form of government became increasingly tenuous to maintain. It was therefore no surprise that at some point, the Riksledare declared all seats in the Riksdag to be part of his own party the 'Svea Rikes Nationella Samlingsparti'. Once this was done, power was transferred to the Riksdag, which immediately moved to permanently affirm Gyllenkrok's status as Riksledare in a law that allowed the holder of said office to bypass the Riksdag itself in the Swedish instruments of government. At this point, the Riksledare possessed almost unlimited power and Sweden as it was known before the coup would be forever gone."
swe.37.a:0 "It's different but still the same."

swe.38.t:0 "The New Instruments of Government"
swe.38.d:0 "The Riksdag has passed a new set of instruments of government which serves as the Swedish constitution. The new document explicitly excludes parties subscribing to marxist or syndicalist thought, and entrenches the right of the Swedish monarch to exercise its reserve powers, as well as other minor amendments that heavily favour the conservative government."

swe.42.d:0 "While Per Albin Hansson was not without his faults - he was very strongly in favour of the rather hopeless strategy of working within the bourgeoise government to amend it - the man has shown himself to be a true hero of the revolution. After all, it was clear that he was most definitely intending to bring about the establishment of this republic as evidenced by the abdication of the king he pushed. Sadly, this great hero of the revolution perished at the hands of the military at the opening stages of a coup. If it wasn't for the heroic actions of a VPT militia, we may never have been able to find back his body.\nOf course, such a glorious revolutionary needs to be remembered, and for that reason we have commissioned a large statue in the city where Hansson grew up: Malmö."

swe.45.d:0 "Many within the government considered the neutrality that has been de-facto maintained by Sweden since 1815 holy. However, Norway has fallen to the syndicalist menace, and, not only that: they joined the Third International of the French Commune and the Union of Britain. In addition, aggressive rhetoric towards 'the liberation of the evil capitalist tyranny of Sweden' is almost a daily occurence among some in the rogue state that has spawned in the place of our wester neighbour.\n\nWith these threats and keeping in mind that their formal ascension to the Third International alliance may mean that the Norwegians will let loose their Anglo-French attack dogs on us, many consider it wise to abandon our neutrality, dear to us it may be, as the syndicalists won't have problems violating it and it would make us only vulnerable to attack, in favour of an alliance with the Germans, our avid trade partners and known rival to the Third International."

swe.49.d:0 "Since their defeat in 1936, the fate of the conservative General Electoral League has been one of misfortune. The party has been seeing much of its support defecting to the Social Democrats of Hansson, and those who supported the League in opposition to the Social Democrats are going back to the Folkpartiet if the polls are to be believed.\nIn an attempt to rebrand the party that is now the bastion of right-wing opposition and to reverse its fortunes once more, party leadership has elected to change the partyname into the National Organisation of the Right (Högerns Riksorganisation).

swe.53.d:0 "For a while, it seemed like disenfranchising the social democrats had made conservative control over Sweden unopposed. It seems however, that in their absence, the liberal Folkpartiet has risen to prominence, with much of the old social democratic support base now putting their weight behind them, knowing that while they do not espouse the same economic ideals as them, they do support bringing the SAP back into the legality and restoring freedom like it used to be before the conservatives made their control virtually impenetrable using the law."

swe.54.d:0 "For an extended amount of time, the conservatives have been the most influential party in Sweden, but this seems to be over. First they lost the government to the social democrats, and as they continued to fail to decisively recapture it, their performance at the polls has been declining. Last elections it has finally happened: with the conservatives once again winning the least amount of seats since the establishment of the modern Riksdag, they have lost their standing as the second-largest party and dropped to the third place in favour of the liberals, who will now take over the leadership over the Swedish opposition."

swe.59.d:0 "Many within both the liberal and agrarian parties had been agitated when the conservatives changed the instruments of government to disenfranchise a large part of the nation. Now that the Folkpartiet rules Sweden - ironically arguably due to the forceful exclusion of the social democrats - it is therefore no surprise that they roll back these changes. In addition, they have entrenched the instruments, so that henceforth a two-third majority will be required to amend the instruments."

swe.77.d:0 "The extensive use of propagandaspeakers we let the communal government implement has had a mediocre effect it seems: while indeed the membership of totalist unions has increased marginally more than in the rest of the country, there have been several complaints that the loud noise of the loudspeakers keeps them out of their concentration (at work) or sleep (at night). Several loudspeakers have even been damaged and required replacement. It seems the experiment is moderately unsuccesful."

swe.78.d:0 "Following the establishment of the worker's state, an imminent problem was the press: most newspapers and as well as the national radio service remained active in the aftermath of the Swedish revolution and some of them even had the gall to criticise the new order.\n\nWhile all factions among the revolutionaries agreed that blatant bourgeoise propagandastations like the capitalist Svenska Dagbladet can obviously not remain active as it is, they all proposed a different approach. The Flyggists of the VPT proposed their plan of 'Likriktning': all media in Sweden ought to be put under strict government surveillance to ensure the revolution remains well-protected from reactionary lies. The syndicalists of the SAC had a different proposition: all media should be reorganized in a single newswriters union under the general Swedish Landsorganisationen, which will ensure the content will be objective and not spread falsehoods to the detriment of the socialist order. Finally, the radical socialists of the SSV propose cautiousness; while they agree that obviously reactionary newsmedia should be dissolved, they want us to leave the rest of the media alone."

swe.79.d:0 "Many non-totalist socialists were rather dissatisfied with the actions of the VPT's paramilitary organisations against reactionaries. By their accounts, the hunt has cost the lives of many who could not even be considered a threat to the revolutionary order, and made it a lot harder to convince Swedes that did not yet subscribe to the revolution that this was really the best way forward.\n\nAs a result of this, they proposed to establish a new agency that would receive the sole authority to protect Sweden from counterrevolutionary activity and with official government support. Somewhat to their surprise, the totalists jumped right on this idea and propose far-reaching powers for this new 'Sekretariatet för Statssäkerhet' - it seems like they are hoping to gain control over it."

With the different positions around the government under totalist control, the main political threat to continued unity of Sweden were the unions, that could technically enforce a congress to force a change of government.

One day, after such a speech, the 'Folkets Dagblad' which the Swedish leader once redacted started with a front article lauding the great leadership of the General Secretary so far and his wisdom.\n\nThe Article has caught the attention of the leader and his cabinet, who start to consider that letting the media focus on the qualities of Nils Flyg could be politically beneficial."

This is of course a great way to further the popular knowledge about their general secretary, but some discord started to boil over whether we - and comrade Nils in particular - should hold a tight leash on what is being written. Some in the cabinet want us to subject this endeavor under close government control, while others believe that in the knowledge that the Writer's Union is known to be politically correct means it wouldn't become a character assassination, and that if it would turn out in such a way we can always censor it before it is released."

The book ends in describing the instrumental role Flyg played in the Swedish revolution, which could be considered a departure from the government stance that had been held since the revolution, where the ultimate sacrifice of Per Albin Hansson was accredited as the main event that sowed the seeds for a revolutionary regime."

In general the book is positive about Flyg's endeavours, praising for instance his capacity to self-educate in his early youth allowing him to rise among the many workers in the socialist movement at the beginning of the 20th century, but also strikes a critical tone at times: for instance the implication is made that the strength of the socialist movement was hurt a lot by Flyg's decision to move forward with his own party, which contributed to the fracturing of Swedish socialism. Indeed the book also puts some weight in criticising the absence of Flyg during the most uncertain hours of the revolution while totalist paramilitaries roamed the streets."
swe.88.a:0 "Criticism is healthy, go ahead!"
swe.88.b:0 "Oh no, I think not!"

swe.89.t:0 "The General Secretary visits a Workplace"
swe.89.d:0 "In order to bring the touch of the regime closer to the people, the General Secretary, a former industrial worker himself, has arrived to visit a factory where Sweden's industrial heart beats the strongest. One of the civil servants of the secretariat of economics has in the meanwhile drafted a plan to increase the efficiency of factories such as these. One of the junior members of the General Secretary's entourage proposes disposing of the civil servant and bringing the idea as comrade Flyg's own in the ending speech he will give, which would show the wisdom of comrade Flyg to the Swedish people."
swe.89.a:0 "A cunning plan! Make the arrangements."
swe.89.b:0 "Laud the Civil Servant for his achievement!"

swe.90.t:0 "Nils Flyg has a Heart Attack"
swe.90.d:0 "Tragedy: our General Secretary, Nils Flyg, has been hit by a heart attack today. Fortunately, he survived the calamity, but after being rushed to the doctor the doctor explains that Flyg will never be the same again. He will likely suffer from short breath henceforth which will likely become progressively worse in the future. And there is a risk that he will suffer a second heart attack. The doctor recommends that comrade Flyg takes as much rest as possible."
swe.90.a:0 "Rest? The General Secretary of Sweden never rests!"

swe.91.t:0 "The General Secretary's ill health starts to become public!"
swe.91.d:0 "Since comrade Flyg's heart attack, his short-breathedness has progressively become worse as the doctor predicted. As a result, the General Secretary eventually caved and dialed down his public appearances, which in turn is feeding the rumour among the Swedish populace that something is wrong with their General Secretary - with the news about the heart attack carefully being censored.\n\nBecause of our... zealous investment in the cult of personality of Nils Flyg, words are spreading that this is the proof that the government is deceiving the Swedish populace, trying to portray Flyg as a God when he is really just a man that can also fall ill."
swe.91.a:0 "Hold a Rally to prove that Flyg is just fine!"
swe.91.b:0 "Time to switch to damage control!"

swe.92.t:0 "The Rally is Unsuccessful"
swe.92.d:0 "The rally we organised to prove the health of our eternal general secretary has not been able to end the doubts; in fact, the situation has worsened as a result because while the speech started relatively smooth, it was easy to observe that the General Secretary was not well from the very beginning and as the speech continued a clear fatigue overcame the General Secretary. It made one journalist even feel bold enough to want to write that Nils Flyg's life has been shortened by three months by this event. Naturally, this counterrevolutionary scum has swiftly been taken care of."
swe.92.a:0 "I tell you, he is in good health!"

swe.93.t:0 "A Hotel Room has been requisitioned"
swe.93.d:0 "As the condition of our General Secretary slowly deteriorates, he has become unable to make the daily travel from villa Tomtebo, the home of Flyg he acquired in 1924. As it is important for his duties as General Secretary that he is able to convene with congress and other officials of the Swedish state, he has requisitioned a hotel room close to the Stockholm castle, where the assembly convenes and he has his office. Reportedly he is distressed by the fact that he will for the time being live in a hotel room."
swe.93.a:0 "It's for the good of the country..."

swe.94.t:0 "The Motion Linderot"
swe.94.d:0 "Since the totalist seizure of power, the Swedish congress had become a mere rubberstamping institution for General Secretary Flyg, with little in the way of upsets. The congress was filled with committed totalists, except for about ~30% of the delegates, who were not removed to retain the pretense of democracy and had rallied around Nils Flyg's former associate Karl Kilbom and basically unsuccessfully vote against almost every proposal, with every proposal getting the exact same amount of seats in favour and against since the consolidation of VPT control.\n\nThis morning, this atmosphere of political apathy was suddenly crushed: Sven Linderot, the leader of a faction within the VPT in favour of greater internationalism and a lesser (European) nationalist doctrine with the party, suddenly pitched a motion to establish a 'Politiska Byrån' - political bureau - to take over the General Secretary's duties on behalf of congress as long as his condition will not allow him to properly exercise said duties. This was swiftly condemned by Flyg loyalists, headed by Arvid Olsson, yet the Kilbommare, witnessing this split in their nemesis, capitalised and supported the motion. For the first time since 1937, a motion against the will of the Flyggists passed."
swe.94.a:0 "How dare they!"

swe.95.t:0 "The Appointment of the 'Politiska Byrån'"
swe.95.d:0 "Following the passing of the Linderot Motion through congress, congress had to elect the delegates that would become members of the bureau. Unsurprisingly, Linderot had pitched his own list with himself as the chairman of the bureau and loyalists for the rest, which would essentially give him all power Flyg previously possessed. The Kilbommare did not cave to that however, and moved to present their own alternative list of syndicalist democracy proponents headed by Kilbom himself. Olsson and the Flyggists were wary of being left the opposition incapable of stopping the motion again, and resolved it would be better to help one of the two sides to the majority they require to take the bureau - hopefully the side that would be the least capable of removing Flyg from power."
swe.95.a:0 "Support Linderot - at least he is totalist!"
swe.95.b:0 "Support Kilbom - at least he didn't betray us!"

swe.96.t:0 "Politiska Byrån orders Flyg be moved home!"
swe.96.d:0 "With his hold over the Political Bureau of his own creation, Sven Linderot was given de-facto in control over the country. The first act of the bureau is to have Flyg be moved back to Tomtebo. According to the bureau, this is so the General Secretary can rest, but most consider the real underlying reason is to render Flyg politically pacified. After all, without his hotelroom Flyg can't easily get to the halls of power in a good condition and thus it will be significantly easier for Linderot and his companions to control the country and Flyg's omnipresent supporters. Unsurprisingly, the General Secretary resisted with all the power he had, but the police officers 'to protect him' were relentless."
swe.96.a:0 "It is for your own good, Nisse!"

swe.97.t:0 "The Political Bureau gathers for the next move!"
swe.97.d:0 "With the General Secretary out of the picture, the control of the Political Bureau is unlimited. Now a choice lies before Linderot: either he could announce Flyg's resignation now while Flyg is incapable to react and in poor health, or he could hold his horses, ruling the country for the foreseeable future, taking the gamble that Flyg will not recover and possibly go after him in the future for what he just did."
swe.97.a:0 "Announce Flyg's resignation!"
swe.97.b:0 "Let us remain just where we are!"

swe.98.t:0 "Electing a General Secretary"
swe.98.d:0 "With Nils Flyg 'resigned' Linderot's own ambitions have been exposed. The Flyggists and mixed totalists, now firmly aware of what Linderot is trying to do and that Flyg's resignation wasn't his own decision, pitch comrade Flyg and exclaim that they will never support 'the rat' Sven Linderot for General Secretary, saying they'll put in even Kilbom into that office before Linderot. The Kilbommare opposition meanwhile, seek to do exactly that, but also among them it is clear, that by the guise of 'better the devil you know' and the consideration that Flyg is in poor shape, they are inclined to support Flyg. It seems Linderot has overplayed his hand; he has lost the race before it even began and knowing that either side won't be soft on him for his attempted powergrab, his supporters are bailing out left and right. The question is however, which side will cave to the other first?"
swe.98.a:0 "Flyg is reelected in the third round!"
swe.98.b:0 "Kilbom is elected in the third round!"

swe.99.t:0 "The purge of the Linderot faction!"
swe.99.d:0 "With the removal of Flyg, the Political Bureau was automatically dissolved too as it was a kind of regency for the General Secretary. As such, Linderot and his loyalists had been planning to invoke the articles included in their motion to reestablish the political bureau. However, these plans were cut short when the authorities arrived at Linderot's doorstep and arrested him on the suspicion of reactionary sympathies. In a show trial the same day he was with hastily convicted to thirty years of hard labour and sent on his way to a prison complex in the north of Sweden specifically designated for enemies of the regime. He was not seen again in Stockholm.\n\nSeveral other staunch Linderot loyalists have been put into custody too. The power of Linderot and his internationalist totalists has been broken."
swe.99.a:0 "Good Riddance!"

swe.100.t:0 "Politiska Byrån dissolves congress!"
swe.100.d:0 "With Kilbom in control of the bureau that takes care of the duties of the most important office of the country, the bureau has decreed that the political barriers imposed by General Secretary Flyg earlier are to be removed and had the congress dissolve. In a month's time all delegates of the congress shall face a free election, with no political barriers holding you back from partaking. It is obvious that the Kilbommare are out on getting a congress hostile to totalist rule to commence a recall vote on General Secretary Flyg, to then restore democracy."
swe.100.a:0 "Time to start campaigning!"

swe.101.t:0 "Recall vote on Nils Flyg"
swe.101.d:0 "After vigorous campaigning, free elections have been held and changed the composition of congress. As such, we are now pitching a recall vote to try and remove Nils Flyg from power, which will let us in turn elect a new General Secretary and safeguard revolutionary democracy in Sweden."
swe.101.a:0 "The recall vote passes, Nils Flyg is removed!"
swe.101.b:0 "The recall vote fails, Flyg remains in power."

swe.102.t:0 "Electing a General Secretary"
swe.102.d:0 "The syndicalist-democratically aligned congress removed Nils Flyg from his office as General Secretary, which probably helps him more than it hurts him, considering his fragile health. Congress must now elect a new General Secretary however. Most agree that Karl Kilbom - now the saviour of Swedish revolutionary democracy - should become the new General Secretary on behalf of the SSV. The SAC did nominate Frans Severin however and members from both parties have formed an alliance in the hopes of abolishing the office of General Secretary altogether, considering that it only leads to tyranny."
swe.102.a:0 "Kilbom is elected General Secretary."
swe.102.b:0 "Severin is elected General Secretary."
swe.102.c:0 "Congress abolishes the office."

His wife was rushed to his hotelroom as fast as possible but when she arrived it had already been too late - the General Secretary passed away alone. While she lost her husband, Sweden lost its leader, and chaos overtakes congress as a vacuum in power has suddenly spawned out of this as a result. This vacuum was soon filled however: with Linderot and Kilbom having been outplayed earlier and the VPT faction reunited, it seems clear who shall become the new chairman of the VPT."

For better or for worse though, he was at home at his Tomtebo villa; had he remained in the hotel room that he had been assigned at first, he might well have died alone, without his wife and closest supporters by his side.\n\nCongress was swift in declaring Sven Linderot the second Chairman of Sweden, who had discretely been consolidating his power while ruling in Flyg's place.

### Swedish Socialism elections ###

swe_syncon.1.t:0 "The Revolutionary Committee assembly - Governmental Status"
swe_syncon.1.d:0 "The Revolutionary Committee has been assembled for its first session. Tensions are high as all three parties are vying for power in this new, strange political climate. Membership numbers for all parties are exploding, although Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Vänsterparti (SSV) is the largest one by far. \n\nFrom his podium, Karl Kilbom of the SSV advocates that in the new Sweden, we (the state) look after everyone who needs it, without prying into the affairs of common citizenry. Nils Flyg of Vänsterpartiet Totalisterna (VPT) claims that citizenry police needs to be established, to 'safeguard the revolution' while Albert Jensen of Sveriges Syndikalistiska Parti (SSP) claims that every commune should look after their own." 
swe_syncon.1.a:0 "Jensen has the right of it."
swe_syncon.1.b:0 "Kilbom wins this round."
swe_syncon.1.c:0 "Nils Flyg controls the debate."

swe_syncon.2.t:0 "The Revolutionary Committee assembly - Economic System"
swe_syncon.2.d:0 "The Revolutionary Committee has assembled for a second time. The initial belief that seizing power in Sweden would unify the left has now completely waned. Reforming the economy of Sweden is the topic of the day, and speaking sharply for the SSV is Anna Johansson Visborg, claiming that strong unions and government influence will secure worker's rights. \n\nThe VPT representative, Sven Linderot, claims that all workers should be gathered into a single, large union, and a the focus should be on massive state funded projects. Finally, Gustav Sjöström of the Syndicalists proposes the idea of commune based economy, where every region should strive to be self-sufficient."
swe_syncon.2.a:0 "Sjöström has the right of it."
swe_syncon.2.b:0 "Visborg wins this round."
swe_syncon.2.c:0 "Linderot controls the debate."

swe_syncon.3.t:0 "The Revolutionary Committee assembly - Military Matters"
swe_syncon.3.d:0 "For a third time the Revolutionary Committee holds session. With the current military disloyal to the red cause, the various leaders are discussing radical army reforms. Zeth Höglund of the SSV wants to reintegrate the Swedish army through education of staff and soldiers, where soldiers council's should elect officers out of their own ranks. \n\nGustav Johansson from VPT claims that a strong army needs a strong central command, and that a National School for politically indoctrinated officers must be the backbone of our new army. The SSP representative, Nisse Lätt, believes armies should be trained and used for local, defensive deployment and only summoned elsewhere for extreme situations."
swe_syncon.3.a:0 "Lätt has the right of it."
swe_syncon.3.b:0 "Höglund wins this round."
swe_syncon.3.c:0 "Johansson controls the debate."

swe_syncon.4.t:0 "The Revolutionary Committee assembly - Societal Doctrine"
swe_syncon.4.d:0 "Our fourth session has been assembled. Outside the doors, Sweden lies in chaos, but inside we are assured we can sort it out. Our new society must build upon equality, a strong union and compassion for your fellow man, or so claims Östen Unden of SSV. \n\nHilding Hagberg from VPT believes that we must put faith in a strong man to lead us all into an era where Sweden isn't just a strong nation, it's a great nation, rivaled by none and feared by all! The most passionate of all speakers however is the SSP representative Elise Ottosen Jensen, who envisions her dream of a society free of oppression, where one cares and shares with your local community."
swe_syncon.4.a:0 "Jensen has the right of it."
swe_syncon.4.b:0 "Undén wins this round."
swe_syncon.4.c:0 "Hagberg controls the debate."

swe_syncon.5.d:0 "The Totalists have achieved a total victory in the revolutionary assemblies. With a majority of our latest proposals having been approved, it turns out that our strategy of talking the loudest during the debates has been successful. With a new Totalist regime ready to rule Sweden with an iron fist, it is clear who will become the General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly: Nils Svante Flyg, undisputed leader of the totalist movement shall rise to power and stand at the top while Sweden shall rise in this new age!"
swe_syncon.5.a:0 "Nils Flyg will raise Sweden to the sky."

With a new radical socialist regime ready to climb to the seat of ultimate power as General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly we have a single, last decisions to make. \n\nWho should sit there? Many thought of Kilbom, a former sailor and journalist, as the obvious choice, but the famous and incredibly popular poet and writer Karin Boye has soared in the party ranks as of late."
swe_syncon.6.a:0 "Karl Kilbom is what Sweden needs."

With a new syndicalist regime ready to climb to the seat of ultimate power as General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly we have a single, last decisions to make. \n\nWho should sit there? The last draw has come down in between Elise Ottesen-Jensen, a former sex-educator and agitator and wife of Albert Jensen, another major figure in the syndicalist movement, and her adversary Frans Severin, another influential member of the SAC congress."
swe_syncon.7.a:0 "Elise Ottosen-Jensen is our choice."

Who should sit there? \n\nEither the Totalist option of Nils Flyg, a former editor in chief and undisputed leader of the totalist movement, will shoulder the responsibility or perhaps Kilbom, the former sailor and journalist is a better choice? Either way, one side is doomed to feel left out, and Sweden might suffer from this split."

### Flavor Event ###

swe_flavor.1.t:0 "Karin Boye releases För Lite."
swe_flavor.1.d:0 "Karin Boye, a prominent author, poet and female rights activist coloured by socialism has just released her latest piece. It's a novel called För Lite (Too Little or For Little) and centres around the themes of working to achieve your dreams or make your ends meet, and your responsibility to yourself as a person and to your family and friends. Boye is very popular and her new novel is a success."
swe_flavor.1.a:0 "I shall have to read it sometime."

swe_flavor.2.t:0 "Greta Garbo stars in Camille."
swe_flavor.2.d:0 "Greta Garbo stars in the American produced movie Camille, a romantic drama. Greta Garbo is one of the biggest names in the movie industry, both in Sweden and in the world. The movie is rather harmless and holds a high quality production but some of the more conservative elements of our society are most upset... Her clothes are a bit revealing! They are calling for a censorship. What should we do?"
swe_flavor.2.a:0 "That outfit is too revealing! Censor it!"
swe_flavor.2.b:0 "It seems most entertaining. Send me a ticket!"

swe_flavor.3.t:0 "Five year commemoration of Ådalen"
swe_flavor.3.d:0 "In May 1931 a large march of strikers marched towards barracks for blacklegs who were working at local factories. The police had called in the military for support and before the day was over, the riots had ended in five strikers being killed by military fire. Ever since then yearly marches are held in memory of the dead workers among socialists, although conservatives claim that the workers were armed and attacked them first. The strikes of this year are unusually large. What should we do?"
swe_flavor.3.a:0 "Let them. They'll tire eventually."
swe_flavor.3.b:0 "Wasn't once enough? Send in the military!"

swe_flavor.4.t:0 "Final sentence of the Sala-gang"
swe_flavor.4.d:0 "In the summer of last year a gang led by a name called Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman (a name he added himself, presumably because it is an anagram for Manhunter) was arrested for a murder. Soon the investigations reached nationwide front news as it turned out that the gang was not only guilty of murders dating all the way back to 1931, but also because it was ran more or less like an occult group and went under the nickname 'The Magic circle''. \n\nThe leader and the conspirators were sentenced in court the other day, most of them to life in prison but the leader was considered so mentally ill that he was sentenced to closed psychiatric care. Many people are outraged, and would have wanted to see Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman put away for good!"
swe_flavor.4.a:0 "We must respect the court's decision. Closed care it is."
swe_flavor.4.b:0 "Arrange for this monster to be relocated to a prison."

swe_flavor.5.t:0 "Manhunter on the loose!"
swe_flavor.5.d:0 "Two years ago, Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman was sentenced to closed psychiatric care but our politicians overruled the decisions and put him in prison. In prison his mental state reportedly worsened, and just after Christmas last year he broke out and murdered a taxi driver and stole his car. The police lacks any good leads and fear he may have gone underground or even left the country..."
swe_flavor.5.a:0 "내가 뭘 했어야 했는데?!"

swe_flavor.6.t:0 "호텔 총파업!"
swe_flavor.6.d:0 "After failed negotiations with the unions a major hotel strike has caused a hotel lockout in Sweden. From Stockholm to Göteborg to Malmö you won't find a single hotel which is properly staffed. Striking down at the protestors violently could disperse them... or set off a backlash, while negotiation with them could make the red parties grow. We could just ignore them, but that might hurt our economy, at least for a while."
swe_flavor.6.a:0 "Let's replay Ådalen, send in the military!"
swe_flavor.6.b:0 "Let's negotiate with them."
swe_flavor.6.c:0 "Ignore them. Surely it will stop?"

swe_flavor.7.t:0 "City massacre"
swe_flavor.7.d:0 "Our brave soldiers nobly defended the government directives when the strikers, reds and other rabble started throwing bottles and rocks. The turmoil and riots lasted for the entire day and over a dozen workers have been killed before the protestors were fully cleared. For some reason a couple of journalists managed to leak pictures of bleeding civilians in the streets of Göteborg, and now Sweden is in shock!"
swe_flavor.7.a:0 "If they had only stayed home..."

swe_flavor.8.t:0 "호텔 총파업 종료"
swe_flavor.8.d:0 "For several months the strike has been going on, hurting our economy and our prestige, but eventually we tired them out. The strikes have ended and things are back to normal... For now."
swe_flavor.8.a:0 "신이시어 감사합니다!"

swe_flavor.9.t:0 "Funeral of Gösta Ekman"
swe_flavor.9.d:0 "The legend of Gösta Ekman, Sweden's most popular actor and theatre-director, passed away at age 47 after a period of sickness. In the last eleven years, Ekman was part of no less than twenty three productions. Following his funeral train in the streets of Stockholm, over 100 000 (!) people, roughly a fifth of the city, watched the coffin pass and mourned the end of a Swedish legend."
swe_flavor.9.a:0 "We all mourn today."

swe_flavor.10.t:0 "Astrid Kindstrand on the radio"
swe_flavor.10.d:0 "A few days ago, Astrid Kindstrand read the news on Sweden's Radio, the national radio channel, the first woman to do so in Swedish history. In the following days, hundreds of angry phonecalls and letters reached the state and various newspapers across the country to complain that a woman is allowed to read state news."
swe_flavor.10.a:0 "Don't they have anything else to be upset about?"

swe_flavor.11.t:0 "Landstormens Lilla Lotta"
swe_flavor.11.d:0 "A new Swedish comedy movie has hit the theatres and reached a surprising amount of popularity. It plays a bit with the traditional story of Romeo and Julia but also throws things of order upside down, such as making the bank director a private when he joins the army and the groundskeeper a commander. Everyone fools around and no one takes their military training seriously while falling in love with one of the pretty women of the Lotta-corps."
swe_flavor.11.a:0 "Oh ho ho! I love me some jolly movies!"
swe_flavor.11.b:0 "How dare they mock the Swedish military like this?! Censor it!"

swe_flavor.12.t:0 "Garbo skrattar - Ninotchka!"
swe_flavor.12.d:0 "Garbo laughs - That is how the movie is marketed all across the world, as the Swedish, beautiful mega-star Greta Garbo does her first attempt at a comedy movie. The movie centres around Garbo in the role of Ninotchka, an ice-cold syndicalist who finds love and abandons her political ideas to move to a capitalist society. Even though it is tounge-in-cheek, and makes fun of the capitalist society too, it is clear that it mocks all forms of syndicalism."
swe_flavor.12.a:0 "She is so beautiful! Get me a ticket!"
swe_flavor.12.b:0 "How dare they mock the glorious Swedish revolution?! Censor it!"

swe_flavor.13.t:0 "Kallocain released"
swe_flavor.13.d:0 "Kallocain is a novel written by the ever busy Karin Boye. It takes place in a dystopian, fictive nation where critizising the state is strictly illegal and the state controls every single part of your life. It reflects on men and women, on class issues and the conflicts that arise from these issues. It is, ultimately, a depressing read. It takes brutal stabs at any totalitarian regimes, left or right."
swe_flavor.13.a:0 "A fascinating and disturbing read!"
swe_flavor.13.b:0 "How dare she mock the strong, glorious state? Censor it!"

swe_flavor.14.t:0 "Death of Karin Boye"
swe_flavor.14.d:0 "Karin Boye was found lifeless on a hill north of Alingsås after she had, seemingly intentionally, overdosed on sleeping pills. The poet and author was known for her emotional instability, in particular over the last few months. Even more so perhaps since one of the the women she loved, Anita Nathorst, was dying of cancer. Her sexuality was a public secret, and the pressure of it all might have been too much."
swe_flavor.14.a:0 "Visst gör det ont när knopparna brister..."

swe_flavor.15.t:0 "IKEA 설립"
swe_flavor.15.d:0 "The other day a seventeen year old lad named Ingvar Kamprad founded a small company for selling everything from pencils and fishing tools, to stockings and belts. It is run from his parent's private farm as a mail order company and appearently he will personally bike out to your home and deliver the goods to your front door."
swe_flavor.15.a:0 "야망있는 청년으로 보이는군."

swe_flavor.16.t:0 "신 말뫼 극장 오픈"
swe_flavor.16.d:0 "The recently opened Malmö City Theatre is one of the largest theatres in Europe, and offers and impressive display indeed. For the opening night it will show the classic of 'A midsummer night's dream', the Shakespear classic."
swe_flavor.16.a:0 "표를 주시오!"

swe_flavor.17.t:0 "Arvid Lindman passes away"
swe_flavor.17.d:0 "Arvid Lindman was a conservative politician, a member of the navy staff and considered among many as a father of the Nation. The former admiral reigned as prime minister in between 1906 to 1911 and then again, more or less as a permanent head of government, from 1924 until 1934, when he stepped down in favour of the younger Gösta Bagge. \n\nIt is said that Bagge rarely took any decisions without asking for advice from the senior Lindman, but no longer. A public funeral will be held and attended by the King and other people of fine birth."
swe_flavor.17.a:0 "A great statesman is gone" 
 
swe_flavor.18.t:0 "Arvid Lindman is dead"
swe_flavor.18.d:0 "Arvid Lindman was a conservative politician, a member of the navy staff and considered among many to be a tyrant who did everything he could to kill democracy and socialism in it's cradle. He reigned as a prime minister in between 1906 to 1911 and then again, more or less as a permanent head of government, from 1924 until 1934, when he stepped down in favour of the younger Gösta Bagge. \n\nWhen our revolutionary government proclaimed Sweden to be a republic, he was among the first to flee abroad and he died, alone and unwanted, in a flat in Berlin."
swe_flavor.18.a:0 "A great tyrant is gone"

swe_flavor.19.t:0 "Valkyriorna formed"
swe_flavor.19.d:0 "With war coming to the shores of Sweden, the stunt-pilot Elsa Andersson, known for her daring parachuting in the twenties, has requested to form a women's only air brigade. The project has adopted the name 'Valkyriorna', after the winged women of ancient norse mythology who oversaw which warriors would be slain on the battlefield. Women have gathered in droves to sign up, wanting the chance to fight for Sweden, but the idea is not undisputed. Many feel that women in the army is not fitting with a modern civilised nation."
swe_flavor.19.a:0 "Everyone who wants to fight for Sweden is welcome!"

### Decisions ###
SWE_fix_black_monday_category:0 "검은 월요일 대응"
SWE_fix_black_monday_category_desc:0 "스웨덴 경제는 독일과 밀접하게 연관되어있고, 이로 인해, 베를린의 경기 침체가 곧 스웨덴의 경제에 타격을 주었습니다. 총리는 스웨덴이 경기침체로 병들어가는 것을 막기 위해 재무장관 산하의 위기관리위원회를 설립했습니다. 그러나 실업률이 증가하고 징수되는 세금이 줄어들게 되어, 이 위기를 타개하는 것은 힘든 일이 될 것입니다.\n\n자유 예산: [swedishBudgetAmount] 크로나.\n물가 상승률: [?swe_var_inflation|%-0].\n실업률: [?swe_var_unemployment|%R0].\n관련 부채: [swedishDebtAmount] 크로나."
SWE_drop_gold_standard:0 "금본위 폐지"
SWE_drop_gold_standard_desc:0 "스웨덴 국립은행인 릭스방크는 스웨덴 크로나를 법에 명시된 표준화된 가치만큼의 금으로 교환할 것입니다. 그러나 재정파탄 때에는 정부가 금본위제도를 유예시킬 수 있는데, 이를통해 스웨덴 상품들을 외국에 더 쉽게 판매할 수 있게 만들 수 있으나, 물가 상승을 야기시킬 수도 있습니다."
SWE_print_extra_money:0 "화폐 추가 발행"
SWE_print_extra_money_desc:0 "우리는 릭스방크에게 우리가 사용할 만큼의 돈을 찍어내라고 지시할 수 있습니다. 하지만 이로 인해 크로나의 가치가 하락할 수 있습니다."
SWE_take_a_loan:0 "2백만 크로나 차입"
SWE_take_a_loan_desc:0 "우리는 2백만 크로나를 융자해서 우리의 예산을 늘릴 수 있지만, 무한적으로 할 수는 없을겁니다."
SWE_repay_a_loan:0 "2백만 크로나 상환"
SWE_repay_a_loan_desc:0 "우리의 예산으로 2백만 크로나를 상환할 수 있으니, 더 이상 이자를 지불하지 않아도 될 겁니다."
SWE_cut_funding_on_military:0 "군대 자금지원 중단"
SWE_cut_funding_on_military_desc:0 "우리는 군예산을 삭감함으로써 상당한 돈을 절약할 수 있습니다. 하지만 세계는 점점 불안정해져가고 있기 때문에 섣불리 결정해서는 안 될 것입니다. 게다가 스웨덴의 보수주의자들은 이 조치에 크게 반대하고 있습니다."
SWE_raise_taxes:0 "세금 인상"
SWE_raise_taxes_desc:0 "우리는 세금을 추가적으로 인상함으로써 검은 월요일에 대응하기 위해 사용할 여분의 자금을 끌어모을 수 있습니다. 그러나 이 조치는 시장을 훨씬 더 위축시켜 버릴 수 있을지도 모르며, 스웨덴의 자유주의자들은 이 조치에 크게 반대하고 있습니다."
SWE_cut_welfare:0 "복지 자금지원 중단"
SWE_cut_welfare_desc:0 "We can save quite a bit of money by cutting on welfare expenditure. Such a move may deny those that have been hit the hardest by the crisis a much-needed lifeline, and, unsurprisingly, the Swedish Social Democrats are heavily opposed to such a measure."
SWE_public_work_program:0 "공공사업계획 시작"
SWE_public_work_program_desc:0 "The most straightforward way to combat unemployment is to kickstart large public works projects the unemployed can participate in. They can then use the money they earn with this to take care of their families. As an added bonus, the money they spend will enter the economy and help it recover."
SWE_subsidize_resource_exports:0 "천연자원 수출 지원"
SWE_subsidize_resource_exports_desc:0 "A large part of the Swedish economy relies on the export of raw resources such as iron ore and tungsten. By subsidizing these exports, we will find our fair amount of foreign currency flowing our way, which will aid our recovery significantly."
SWE_nationalize_company:0 "대기업 국유화"
SWE_nationalize_company_desc:0 "Fact is that the goals of major companies are often aimed at making the most profit rather than providing as many people as possible with a living. To that end it might be worthwhile to nationalize one of these major companies and redirect it towards that goal. This will not be cheap, however."
SWE_implement_tariffs:0 "관세 도입"
SWE_implement_tariffs_desc:0 "We can try protecting our own economy by implementing tariffs against the cheap goods that enter Sweden while bringing in some money as well. We are part of Mitteleuropa however, which is a free-trade area; as such, this is technically a violation of our international obligations."
SWE_wrap_up_crisis_commission:0 "위기관리위원회 해산"
SWE_wrap_up_crisis_commission_desc:0 "위기관리위원회는 스웨덴이 검은 월요일의 영향에서 벗어나는 것을 돕기위해 1936년 위기법으로 설립되었습니다. 일단 위기가 끝나고 모든 일들이 제대로 처리된다면, 위원회를 정리할 수 있습니다."
SWE_repay_leftovers:0 "[?swe_var_debt|1]백만 크로나 상환"
SWE_repay_leftovers_desc:0 "남은 융자를 예산으로 상환할 수 있어서 더 이상 이자를 내지 않아도 될 것입니다."
SWE_counter_inflation:0 "릭스방크 이자 인상"
SWE_counter_inflation_desc:0 "스웨덴의 은행들은 릭스방크에서 대출을 받습니다. 이러한 대출에 대한 이자를 증가시킴으로써 우리는 통화 공급에 영향력을 행사하여 물가 상승률을 낮출 수 있습니다."

SWE_geopolitical_actions:0 "지정학적 행동"
swe_join_reichspakt:0 "제국 조약 가입"
swe_join_reichspakt_desc:0 "생디칼리즘이 스웨덴의 국경으로 닥쳐오고 있는 상황에서, 같은 생각을 가진 세력을 눈여겨 보는 것은 신중하게 해야합니다. 독일제국은 현재 최고의 강대국이며, 같은 게르만 동족들은 라틴의 행패에 맞서고 있습니다. 함께 전투에 나섭시다!"
swe_join_internationale:0 "제3인터내셔널 가입"
swe_join_internationale_desc:0 "The dangers to the young revolutionary republic are many, with the fat kaiser viciously looking to end the worker's freedom in its neighbouring countries in its cradle. We should stand together with our Comrades in France and Britain against this menace!"
swe_leave_reichspakt:0 "제국 조약 탈퇴"
swe_leave_reichspakt_desc:0 "We have come to the conclusion that the political climate that was in place when Sweden decided to enter into an alliance with the Germans is no more, and that the alliance is now hampering our goals more than it is aiding it."
swe_leave_internationale:0 "제3인터내셔널 탈퇴"
swe_leave_internationale_desc:0 "In the recent past, the Internationale has unfortunately been moving into a direction that is incompatible with the Swedish doctrine of socialism of European origin that is spreading around the world. The sad truth is that the main worker's alliance is moving towards a dead end and Sweden will not follow it into the ravine."
swe_seize_aland:0 "올란드 침공"
swe_seize_aland_desc:0 "We tried to secure Åland at the end of the first Weltkrieg when Finland and Russia's fate were still not clear. German pressure eventually forced us to retreat, despite our righteous mandate with over 80% of the archipelago's population wishing to join Sweden, and resolved the dispute in their Finnish puppet state's favour. An opportunity might arise to bring the islands into their rightful homeland once more, be that for strategic or nationalist reasons."
swe_subjugate_norway:0 "Subjugate Norway"
swe_subjugate_norway_desc:0 "The Norwegians have enjoyed their independence long enough. It is time for Sweden to reclaim its birthright as the country that dominates and shapes the Scandinavian geopolitical scene and a Norway that doesn't bend the knee to Stockholm does not constitute a proper part of the new Nordic order."

swe_subjugate_finland_desc:0 "Finland has historically been under Swedish dominion ever since the Northern Crusades in the 13th and 14th century, until we had to surrender it to the Russians in 1809. Now is time to strangle the decadent Finnish state that was born out of the poor Russian administration and restore the rightful order over the Finnish lands once more."

swe_operation_radde_danmark_desc:0 "Denmark formed an alliance with the Germans against the syndicalists, a most probably fatal decision for the country: the German eagle has fallen and the torch and cog now rules Europe. As part of the debris of the German sphere, by all accounts it is expected that they will be destroyed by syndicalist forces soon. For Sweden, this situation is highly inconvenient as a syndicalist regime in Denmark could potentially allow a separate syndicalist invasion of our own homeland, and therefore our officers have made a plan: we invade Denmark first and depose the Danish government in favor of a regime friendly to us, thereby creating a buffer zone between us and the syndicalists of mainland Europe."
