ECU_balance_powers:0 "권력의 균형"

ecu.0.d:0 "에콰도르는 1809년 독립 이래로 험난한 역사를 겪어왔습니다. 국경이 불확실함으로 인해 페루 그리고 콜롬비아와 갈등을 겪었고 고지지역의 보수주의적 대지주와 해안지역의 자유주의적 민중이 심하게 다투었습니다. 친교회파 보수주의자 가브리엘 가르시아 모레노 대통령의 독재 시대에는 상대적인 평화를 누리며 중앙행정, 교육제도, 사회기반시설을 확충하였습니다. 1825년 모레노가 암살된 이후 심각해진 국내 혼란은 자유주의자 엘로이 알파로 장군이 승리하자 잦아들었습니다. 하지만 알파로가 암살당한 동시에 불어닥친 영미발 경제위기로 인해 안정화는 물건너갔습니다. 1921년 보수주의 쿠데타 이후 타마요 대통령은 축출당하고 아르골라 도당이 정권을 잡은 이래로 아직까지 보수주의가 헌법을 무시하며 에콰도르를 지배하고 있습니다. 임기 제한은 역사 속의 이야기일 뿐이며, 대중은 형편없는 수준의 부정선거에 분노하고 있습니다. 그러나 느린 경제 회복은 민중이 정권을 용인하는 이유를 설명해 주고 있습니다. 1936년d에 들어선 오늘, 확실히 La Nueva Argolla의 계획에 걸림돌은 없습니다"

The two dominating parties in the politics of the country, the Radical Liberals and the Conservatives are opposing candidates for another mandate of 5 years. This could sound like business as usual but this election has a special feeling to it: Indeed while the Radical Liberals chose the famous liberal leader of the March Crisis Idiro Ayora as their candidate, the conservatives chose former president José María Velasco Ibarra who was deposed during this same March crisis.

ecu.15.d:0 "La Argolla, meaning 'The Ring' was the name given to the circle of political and economic elites dominating political life first under the liberals in the early 20th century and then under the conservatives after the fall of President Tamayo. The conservative Argolla that was in power until the events of March 1936 was composed mainly of wealthy landowners of the Sierra and of conservative political elites including church members. But, as mentioned, the takeover of power by the liberals led by Ayora precipitated their fall into disgrace and while some try to hold on to positions of importance most have simply went back to their usual activity in hopes of better times for the conservatives in the future. What's sure is that the conservative Argolla definitely lost its hold on the country for this time, perhaps forever."

ecu.16.d:0 "Recently, the centralisation of power around the President Ayora has become evident. New laws are voted each day to strengthen his power and the one of the liberals in the country and it is murmured in the streets and in the newspapers that Ayora might style himself as a dictator, ignoring rules of democracy for his own power. Although those worries are well founded in facts, they don't seem to move the Ecuadorians much, considering this trend has been frequent during the whole history of Ecuatorian democracy. Nevertheless, it will become more and more difficult for the opposition to make its voice heard."
ecu.16.a:0 "독재자라고? 민주적으로 선출되었다는걸 잊어버렸나?"
ecu.17.t:0 "New Laws for a Fairer Ecuador"
ecu.17.d:0 "The new majority in the assembly and the new liberal president have been at work to reform the country and break the influence of the former conservative elite. Part of that process is a classic move of centralisation of power around the president and growing authoritarianism in the Ecuadorian republic, however all of that is made very legally. Indeed, the parliament has been hard at work these last days voting laws reducing its own power and comforting the liberal supremacy despite criticisms from the opposition. This work will continue but the liberal group is divided about the response that should be given to the opposition forces. Should we try to work with them to ease the tensions and make the liberal rule more comfortable or should we refuse any compromise and implement all of what we want alone?"

ecu.18.t:0 "The Coastal Argolla"
ecu.18.d:0 "It's 5PM in Quito in this late saturday afternoon, in a well-known bar named 'El Zorro' close to the presidential palace meets the top of the crop of Ecuadorian society. There liberal politicians meet with wealthy cacao farmers of the coast and the most trendy bankers of Guayaquil. All of this elite, that met for the first time under Eloy Alfaro's regime at the turn of the century reunited for power under the new liberal leader and it is now with them that Ecuador is managed. And it's in this bar that the most important decisions of the country are actually negotiated or even decided. After all the interest of the bankers is to have clients and the interest of the farmers is to have money for their enterprise, in a country where export cultures make up most of the wealth, it is only natural for this duo to be in power..."
ecu.18.a:0 "The liberal world is back on track."
ecu.19.t:0 "과야킬의 부활"
ecu.19.d:0 "Guayaquil, with its port and its banks, was the capital of the liberal world at the start of the 20th century. Even after that period, it stayed a close competer of the supremacy of Quito. The institution of the new Argolla gave wings to the city that is now booming with life again, while the important banks were broken up and controlled by the conservatives they are now regrouping to be as strong as ever and dominate the life in Guayaquil. At the port, exports were severely hit by the impact of Black Monday but cacao and bananas are now flowing again. The city became the point of attention of the whole country and many are the destitute farmers fleeing their land to find a job in the dream of the agitated nights of Guayaquil."
ecu.19.a:0 "Guayaquil, you are a lady!"
ecu.20.t:0 "The Banks' Actions Endanger Farmers"
ecu.20.d:0 "We should have known empowering bankers doesn't only come with advantages, and past examples in history have proven its danger. But nevertheless we didn't listen and gave too much leeway to the bankers in Guayaquil. With their newfound power they began funding and speculating on agriculture like never before, sadly not always to the advantage of the farmers. After a complex financial manipulation involving several relationships between farmers and loaners, a sudden destabilisation of the cultures in a region west of Guayaquil led to the bankruptcy of several cacao farmers, and much profit for the bankers. This unfortunate event turned into a national scandal when these influential farmers started agitating their colleagues against the the government's favor toward the moneymen. Now, spread by newspapers and talked about on the street, we can't ignore this issue anymore and have to bring an answer to it. What will it be?"
ecu.20.a:0 "Punish the banks and relieve the farmers."
ecu.20.b:0 "Do nothing; after all this is the free market."
ecu.21.t:0 "정부 구성"
ecu.21.d:0 "Gallo and his military clique just took over all the political powers in Ecuador and suspended the course of the usual constitution for the time being. As such, the government was dissolved and Gallo replaced it with an unofficial council of advisers largely taking from his friends in the military. However this situation can't last forever and if we want to bring stability to Ecuador we first have to provide it a stable government. Now the question is who to bring in it? Considering the discredit of the Conservative and Liberal parties, even if they are still the most powerful, allying with them would be risky and allying with the gruesome syndicalists of the PSE is out of question. We can also look to the way of the recently-founded Compactación Obrera Nacional, a populist party basing itself on the masses and its hate for syndicalism and created in response to the disaster of the economic crises, it's not the most popular amongst the Ecuadorian elites but it's the closest party to our ideology. Though whatever we choose, a good chunk of the important positions will still be filled by military men to secure the survival of the regime. What shall we do?"

ecu.22.t:0 "칠레 간첩!"
ecu.22.d:0 "Our secret services surprised in the streets of Quito a man with a quite strange behaviour. He was walking, looking uncomfortable, constantly watching around him and some people say they saw a syndicalist emblem on part of his clothes. That's this last clue that convinced our secret services to investigate him more thoroughly. According to their reports they then discovered he wasn't a simple Ecuadorian citizen but a syndicalist spy sent by Chile to probably prepare a future invasion! This unacceptable threat was quickly removed with the sudden arrest of the spy in the middle of a meeting with corrupt politicians in a gloomy bar in Quito. With the spy now in jail and the country enraged at him, we must now decide his fate, should we leave him to a popular trial in the streets or should we prepare a grand and official trial to make an example of him?"
ecu.22.a:0 "Leave him to a popular 'trial'!"
ecu.22.b:0 "Make an official example of him to show those syndies!"
ecu.23.t:0 "The Grandiose Trial of the Spy"
ecu.23.d:0 "The Chilean entered the great court of Quito at 8 in the morning, for the start of the trial, accompanied by the attorney chosen by the interior ministry. Facing him was the judge and most importantly, the prosecutor. In the room, hundreds of people pressed themselves to see the fate of the spy while his several crimes our secret services discovered were listed. After that, a brief time was left for his defence before the speech of the prosecutor and the quick decision of the judge: the spy is the culprit and will be executed by decapitation as soon as possible for the good of the Ecuadorian State. This exemplar protest will be an example for the future of our struggle against dissidents and syndicalists."
ecu.23.a:0 "And the head falls."
ecu.24.t:0 "언론 정화"
ecu.24.d:0 "As part of the process of strengthening the rule of the military in the country, one target will have to be the multiple newspapers Ecuador has. Coming from different sides of the political spectrum and influenced by big parties, the information and analysis conveyed in them don't always appeal to Gallo and might endanger the stability of the new state. As such a reorganisation of the press to bring it more in line with patriotic ideals will be started and we will make sure no one will spread dangerous reports in authorized newspapers anymore."
ecu.24.a:0 "진정한 애국자들만 남겨두어라."
ecu.25.t:0 "Dissent Amongst the Officers"
ecu.25.d:0 "As no revolts happened consequentially to the Gallo coup, it might be believed that all of the army got behind the new government but that would be a foolish assumption. Indeed, apart from Gallo's clique and more authoritarian leaning generals exist an important fraction of the Ecuadorian military that follows progressive ideals and that are growing more and more opposed to the dictatorship of General Gallo. These officers and soldiers claim the army is here not to opress but to defend the people against enemies on the outside and the inside and that protecting democracy is also a part of that mission. This fraction is quickly becoming dangerous for the stability of the government that could be teared apart easily by intense infighting. To prevent this break up, the solution would be to make this fraction totally disappear in one way or another. A quick elimination will solve the problem immediately but will shock not only the people but also more military men and it might be wise to make this elimination more progressive. What will we do?"
ecu.25.a:0 "불충한 분자들을 당장 숙청해라!"

ecu.26.t:0 "Rallying the Army"
ecu.26.d:0 "The army has been a backbone of the construction and stabilisation of Ecuadorian democracy and as such also holds important leverage over its survival or not. To protect democracy, the army must be completely integrated into it and given positions of prestige amongst the Ecuadorian elites. At the same time, we'll teach the youth to love its army and will promote the military with programs throughout the whole nation. The army must become the most loyal defender of democracy if we want it to last."

With their members drawing heavily from the urban popular classes the party uses original actions for Ecuadorian politics like parades in the street and open popular parties that seemed to pay off since, indeed, the party grew a remarkable audience to the point which it could one day pretend to the presidency of the country.

While this secret military exercise was intended by our staff, it didn't make the Ecuadorians too happy and the ambassador started warning us about future incursions and a military response Ecuador might have.

Despite this fact, we never stopped to claim Iquitos as a rightful part of the Pastaza province. But the humiliation of the occupation doubles when, not happy of simply occupying the city, Peruvian authorities use it as a base for military actions in Ecuador. This is what happened this evening when 4 armed Peruvian river boats departed from the city to the Ecuadorian side of the Amazon and proceeded to sail back up the river. It took some time for the Ecuadorian army to warn the boats and force them to get back to where they came and it was long enough for them to provide an extensive reconnaissance of the area.

Unfortunately they were stopped and sent back by the Ecuadorian army and the Ecuadorian government officially denounced what they called an 'agression' and asked for excuses from our officials. This ridiculous claim will have a hard time convincing the government and the army to get to such dishonour but it is obvious the Ecuadorian president was acting more to strenghten his internal position than because he actually had hopes about excuses.

ecu.41.b:0 "키토에서도 페루의 깃발이 휘날려야한다!"
ecu.42.t:0 "페루가 화평을 받아들이다"
ecu.42.d:0 "Peruvian officials got back to us today with the news that the state of Peru accepted our peace offer and will stop the fights immediately to apply the clauses of it. Peruvian soldiers were seen already establishing themselves in Pastaza as conquered land. This is a humiliation for our nation but at least Ecuador still stands."
ecu.42.a:0 "불쌍한 에콰도르여."
ecu.43.t:0 "페루가 화평을 거부하다"
ecu.43.d:0 "Peruvian officials got back to us today with a surprising and frightening news: Peru refused to bring peace to the region by keeping Pastaza and backing down and their government assured their will to get all the way to Quito. Only God knows what future there is in Ecuador now."
ecu.43.a:0 "그럼 이제는 살아남기 위해 싸워야겠군."
