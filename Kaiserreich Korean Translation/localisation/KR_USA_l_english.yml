### Ideas ###
USA_great_depression:0 "대공황"
USA_great_depression_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the New York Stock Market in 1925, the United States has been gripped by the Great Depression. In addition to the massive economic woes plaguing America from this never-ending crisis; the Great Depression has given energy to both Long and Reed as they campaign against one another and the establishment."

USA_black_monday:0 "대공황"
USA_black_monday_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next President knows when this can be over."

USA_political_crisis:0 "정치적 위기"
USA_political_crisis_desc:0 "The United States is in crisis. The Great Depression, which has been ravaging our nation for over a decade, has still not let up. Popular desperation has allowed the far-left Socialist Party of America and the far-right America First Party to gain strength in recent years. Others look to MacArthur and the Army as a way to solve both the depression and radicalization. Many worry that the United States could descend into civil war should our current situation not soon be resolved, or a radical presidential candidate win in the upcoming 1936 Elections."

USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea4_desc:0 "Government-run agencies have started to put people back to work, and some respectable businesses have reopened. The threat of mass starvation has passed, though it is not uncommon to see small hordes of orphans and elderly rooting through trash in the cities."

USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea5_desc:0 "The scars of the war, visible just months ago, have largely faded from the country.

This has been seen by many as an unsporting attack against a political rival, and further confirmation that Reed wishes to turn America into a Syndicalist state like the Commune of France or the Union of Britain."

Citing Lincoln's court-packing during the Civil War as precedent, Reed has asked Senator Majority Leader Meyer London to remove the filibuster for judicial appointees, and has increased the size of the Supreme Court to 15. It is clear that he intends to appoint 6 pro-socialist justices to the bench, which will ensure his Executive Orders will remain constitutional. This has provoked a firestorm of protest, even from the left-leaning Farmer-Labor and Progressive parties, which had upt until now remained neutral or supportive of Reed."

This was due to the retreating strength of the black vote and the diminishing ability of African Americans to reach office after Plessy v. Ferguson. This avenue was also pursued by the syndicalist aligned International Labor Defense, who countered the NAACP for a decade in a competition for the hearts of black voters. Seeing no other option and being unwilling to ever compromise with socialists, NAACP leader Walter Francis White has decided to cooperate with the FBI in an anti-socialist PR campaign.

Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.' Thus begins Quentin Roosevelt's Speech dedicating the creation of Boulder Dam that has finally been completed today."

Now that they have power, the question is how exactly shall railway nationalization go. Congress is debating between two different proposals for how this shall be implemented. The first proposal is that the railroads will be nationalized but not the cars allowing for private businesses to compete among themselves for customers, while the second plan would include the cars in the nationalization.

During the National Convention, Garner refused any oeuvres to take the VP slot for someone else's campaign. Garner's choice of Sam Rayburn came with the implicit understanding that Rayburn's position meant very little to the executive branch. This is why today's newspaper of Rayburn coming out to criticizes Garner for failing to appease radicals was so shocking.

MacArthur's book speaks of his wise ability to see through Long and Reed's campaign, and his willingness to do anything to protect democracy. The book also implies, within his chain of command, there were soldiers who advocated marching on Washington to settle the Capitoline debates.

The gun was aimed at President MacArthur by a madman who, once arrested, claimed MacArthur was building a military junta and must be stopped. The ravings of this loon most interestingly have not been traced back to any political group, and it appears to be a lone wolf attempt on the President's life. MacArthur laughed off this ridiculous accusation and has increased the Secret Service's numbers to protect against any more lone wolves."

Rumours of him associating with industrialists and railing against every president since Hoover including Quentin has come to a head.

ustates.177.d:0 "President Willkie, despite being a lifelong Democrat, never actively endorsed the Southern Democrat line on race. An early critic of John Nance Garner for failing to appeal to black voters in 1936, Willkie made up for that with a historic speech at the NAACP Convention. Speaking in favour of integration in the military, and also getting a few jabs at Republicans and Democrats for failing to protect black voters from the SPA. His speech ended with a support for Jewish rights to democracy, and forewarned that socialists would target them next if antisemitism reached the levels of racism in America. Democrats in Congress are currently ruminating over how to respond, with most wishing to remain silent until next election season."

One provision and its implications so perturbs President Byrd, that a majority of his address to Congress was spent condemning it. That National Highway system, which President Byrd describes as a "massive waste and an enabler of eminent domain", echoing the Conservative Democratic opposition to any Fair Deal that adds land to the Federal Trust. This position puts Byrd in an interesting cross-section, as some Republicans who see the Highway as overtly anti-dissident as well have joined in his cause."

President Taylor has convinced several Progressive Congressmen to revive his old legislation promoting World Unity. Explained as a successor to President Wilson's peace plans he spoke of as the Weltkrieg raged on, World Unity is the preservation of human life and culture and the end of total war. This proposal in Congress was of course defeated, but the gesture has surprisingly boosted President Taylor's reputation."

ustates.182.d:0 "A division appears between President Barkley and the Democratic Party on Fair Deal Infrastructure. A Congressional debate brought up the idea of allowing a smaller community works to be paid by the government, with repair being handled by the Corvée system. The Corvée system is a tax imposed to pay for prisoners to repair public works. President Barkley spoke out against this idea, as his time in Kentucky taught him that penal labour will never surpass contract labour. This stand also puts pressure on Southern Democrats in his own party that support a state-financed and cheap reconstruction plan. National attention to the Corvée system has led to most states outlawing it."

This free labour was compounded by poor living conditions and has eventually come back to haunt Russell. A former prisoner who had his conviction overturned has written a book entitled 'I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!'. This book describes a corrupt penal system and puts the blame on now-President Russell. Those critical of the President are having a field day with this.

Gangsters, sent by the Dutch Schultz to avenge his upcoming execution tried shooting at him through the windows. Fortunately, the Secret Service was able to hide President Dewey, and nabbed the gangsters responsible. As a result, Dewey has doubled his security and pressed for further crackdowns nationwide on crime syndicates, as this attempt may encourage copycats. Both Democrat and Republican in Congress have called J Edgar Hoover into Congress to explain how the FBI did not see this coming. Many on the fence about Dewey are now glad their President has survived such a vile plot."

The world we live in is too dangerous to afford such flippant choices to be made by agents of America, it is General MacArthur's opinion that a new approach to foreign policy is necessary, one that derives consensus from a group of trusted experts. This is what inspired the War and Peace Studies, a calling for only the brightest to represent America in this brave new world. This entity, the so-called the Council on Foreign Relations, will advise General MacArthur on how to suppress radical forces from any corner of the world."

ustates.305.t:0 "The White House and Xanadu"
ustates.305.d:0 "A surprising amount of support came from the pages of the many Hearst Newspapers that dot America. These papers drew up the image of MacArthur as the heroic Cincinnatus, hearing the call to save the Republic from certain destruction. A beacon for MacArthur's allies and the creation of an almost mythical personage through films and newspaper cartoons, Hearst has served as a stabilizing factor to the ship of the state. Even Hearst's attacks on radical unions and populists seemed to echo the words of MacArthur's radio speeches."

ustates.306.t:0 "The new normal in America"
ustates.306.d:0 "When General MacArthur announced that he would not step down as leader those years ago, it was under the pretence of emergency. At the time. hundreds of thousands of Americas were unaccounted for, radicals prowled the countryside funding their politics with looted money, and the democratic pillar was unready to hold up the state. These past few years have seen a great many galvanize into hardy MacArthurites, and a new flavour of politician has emerged in the House of Representatives. These congressmen see the need for an integral military role to check and nurture the business environment and ensure the rights of citizens cannot be infringed due to gridlock."

ustates.307.d:0 "While the United States has an air force, the capability to defend the skies and project power, we do not have an Air Force. The role is split between the US Army in service of our Paratroopers, and the US Navy aboard our Aircraft Carriers. The contention the General Staff addresses today is the ultimate fate of the Air Force, and to which branch should tradition take after. Those in favour of the Army contend that future operations will most likely be in ground support or air drops, while Navy advocates claim that Aircraft are essential to the future of Naval Warfare in engagements large and small. We must choose a side."

ustates.308.t:0 "Super-weapons on a budget"
ustates.308.d:0 "In the last few years, our military research has focused on the potential for internal conflict, narrowing our focus and budget for longer-term projects. This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own personal physics research. On our part, we don't know much about what Wilhelm Reich is talking about, but his reputation in Austria gives us some comfort into whatever science he's using."

ustates.309.d:0 "At home again in Roswell, New Mexico, Goddard again goes to launch test rockets. The last time he was here, the rockets were smaller than his thigh, and reached only a thousand feet in height. Now the rockets soar miles over the desert and touch down with their dummy weights. Goddard's refusal to detonate explosive rockets on the Continental United States prevent the full scale of the damage to be known."

ustates.310.t:0 "Oppenheimer's Bomb a Success"
ustates.310.d:0 "An invitation by Oppenheimer was sent out to nuclear researchers, physicists, and engineers throughout Europe. The promise of escaping persecution in Europe has resounded most strongly to Jewish scientists, some of whom emigrated to the US for the project. After a year and a half of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested. The skies of Alamogordo New Mexico lit up in a flash of destruction as the test bomb Valediction exploded. Oppenheimer later said that the bomb was named after his favourite John Donne poem."

ustates.311.t:0 "Reich's Failed Explosion"
ustates.311.d:0 "After many delays and several attempts to obfuscate the general staff, Wilhelm Reich's bomb project is discontinued and millions of dollars wasted on bunk. This became apparent to Reich's observers when tests showing his energy, named Orgone, could induce exothermic reactions that only he and his associates could see. The bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for its collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation. This embarrassment is currently making its rounds in the papers."
ustates.311.a:0 "Not our proudest moment."
