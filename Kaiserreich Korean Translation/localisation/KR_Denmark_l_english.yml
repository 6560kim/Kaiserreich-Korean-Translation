 DEN_kanslergaden:0 "캔슬러캐더 협정"
 DEN_kanslergaden_desc:0 "불행하게도 덴마크 하원인 'Landsting'은 야당이 통제하고 있으며 정부는 야당의 지원 없이 이끌어나가고 있습니다. 검은 월요일이 가져다 주는 역경에 효과적인 대응을 하려면 야당 지도자들을 캔슬러캐더에 있는 스타우닝의 아파트로 초대해야 합니다."
 DEN_agreement_with_germany:0 "독일과의 협정"
 DEN_agreement_with_germany_desc:0 "영국이 혁명의 불길에 휩싸여 타버리면서 독일과 더 넓은 형태로 미텔오이로파는 우리의 주요 교역국으로 발전했습니다. 문제는 우리의 상품이 이 시장에서 너무 비싸다는 것입니다. 이는 아직 남아 있는 몇 안 되는 무역 장벽을 무너뜨리고 다른 양보를 대가로 독일인보다 우리 농민들을 지원할 수 있는 허가를 받는 것으로 해결될 수 있을 것입니다."
 DEN_schachtian_tactics:0 "샤흐트 경제"
 DEN_schachtian_tactics_desc:0 "독일의 경제학자 얄마르 샤흐트는 위기 동안 경제적 격변과 싸우기 위해 정부가 돈을 쓰도록 함으로써 충격을 완화시키고 더 많은 돈을 시장에 가져오게 하는 이론을 발전시켰습니다. 위기가 너무 심각해서 자유시장에만 의존할 수 없다는 것은 분명하므로 이러한 방침을 채택해야 합니다."
 DEN_public_works:0 "공공 공사"
 DEN_public_works_desc:0 "By spending our money on public works we can employ people that would otherwise be unemployed, meaning they have some money to spend which in turn will bring back life to the market. As a cherry on top we will also be able to improve our infrastructure at a relatively low cost."
 DEN_devalue_the_krona:0 "크로네 평가절하"
 DEN_devalue_the_krona_desc:0 "Part of the problem is that Danish agricultural products are simply too expensive for the crisis-ridden Germans.

 DEN_desanction_lockouts:0 "사무실 폐쇄와 파업 금지"
 DEN_desanction_lockouts_desc:0 "Constant employer-employee conflicts are harsh on our economy: because of the lack of profit due to black monday, employers try to lower the wages, and when employees don't accept this, they simply close the factory until they submit.

 DEN_steinckes_reforms:0 "스테인케의 개혁"
 DEN_steinckes_reforms_desc:0 "Our minister Karl Kristian Steincke has had several extensive reforms to the Danish welfare state planned, but was so far unable to implement them due to the oppositions unwillingness to support it.

 DEN_invalidity_subs:0 "무효적인 보조금"

 DEN_extended_unempl_subs:0 "실업급여"
 DEN_extended_unempl_subs_desc:0 "Many in Denmark have found themselves to be unemployed due to Black Monday. Earlier it would have been private insurance that would have taken this function, but the spike in unemployment has increased the premium to such a degree that few can still afford it. It is the government's duty to create a safety net."
 DEN_simplify_the_sociallove:0 "Simplify the Sociallove"
 DEN_simplify_the_sociallove_desc:0 "The Sociallove of Denmark are at present a patchwork of laws that differ from municipality to municipality. By organising the system on a national level it will become much clearer what rights and allowances every Dane may expect."

 DEN_increase_tax_rate_desc:0 "We can't maintain a balance without some form of action: as a growing segment of the population is unemployed the tax returns have been drastically lowered. To compensate for this we should raise the rates lest we incur a large amount of debt."
 DEN_austerity_measures:0 "긴축 조치"
 DEN_austerity_measures_desc:0 "We cannot maintain the balance with taxes alone: at some point these taxes will simply have a negative effect on the economy and prolong its hardship after all: therefore it is important that we limit our expenses as well."
 DEN_cut_subs:0 "보조금 지급중단"
 DEN_cut_subs_desc:0 "Subsidies particularly are expenses with very limited returns: after all the money invested in these people does not find its way back to the treasury through some sort of revenue and in addition they discourage people from working. They should be drastically cut in the interest of everyone involved."
 DEN_encourage_unempl_insurance:0 "실업 보험"
 DEN_encourage_unempl_insurance_desc:0 "By supporting unemployment insurance we can ensure that the premiums do not rise to such extremes as had been happening in the last months, without having to resort to undue government interference or expenses giving subsidies ourselves. We should definitely support this business!"
 DEN_limit_union_activity:0 "제한적인 노조 활동"
 DEN_limit_union_activity_desc:0 "Syndicalists are a major factor in the limitation of the market economy. It should speak for itself that by limiting the activity of unions the owners of the factories will be able to cut the costs more efficiently and thus move us to recovery faster. It is in the common man's interest as well!"
 DEN_healthy_dose_of_capitalism:0 "The Healthy Dose of Capitalism"

 DEN_reinvigorate_danish_cinema_desc:0 "Our support of the cinema seems to have worked stellarly.

 DEN_expand_belt_ferry_desc:0 "The Great Belt ferries connect the many islands of Zealand together and allow automobile and trains to travel across the islands.

 DEN_bridge_designs:0 "교량 설계"
 DEN_bridge_designs_desc:0 "With the growing issues of Ferries some people have been asking for bridges to connect Denmark together.

The king's position clearly can't be maintained and his abdication is inevitable, but should he simply abdicate according to the normal proceedings, letting his son prince Frederick inherit, or should we take some less orthodox measures to make sure this never happens again? Many support the establishment of a republic."

Haakon however let it be known that while he was flattered by the offering, he would prefer not to ascend to the throne, citing his liking for his former kingdom and fearing that accepting the Danish throne would end any chances of regaining his 'rightful throne'.

Unsurprisingly, Danish radicals, primarily the Danmarks Folkerepublikanske Parti, but to an extent also the Dansk Samling and the maximist wing of the syndicalist Fagoppositions Sammensluting have ratcheted up their rhetoric on this day.\nThe DFP has even organised a large feast 'to celebrate the impending liberation of Slesvig'. This growth of revanchism is most worrisome."

They encountered resistance from one soldier on leave and two customs official, all three of whom were killed by this angry mob. Upon their 'conquest', they declared Christiansfeld to be 'the first of many Slesvig towns to be liberated' and some villagers even cheered to this sentiment. Unsurprisingly however, the nearby German garrison soon after intervened, resulting the Frikorps fleeing back to Denmark, although not before having taken the freedom to beat up a few German-speaking villagers for ratting them out."

Contrary to many Orthodox Syndicalist systems, these are much more open, also to more 'radical voices' like many of the former Radikale Venstre partymembers. Today the vote will be held on who will become secretary of External Affairs: Ib Nørlund, of the orthodox syndicalist faction, who stands for strong relations with the Third Internationale, Hans Hedtoft of Stauning's faction, who is taking a pragmatic approach with full support here and now and review after the war is won, and Otto Mohr, who stands for a distancing of relations after the war is over.

Once again, the three most prevalent factions deliver the candidates who stand a chance: for the orthodox wing, Poul Gissemann once again, on the platform of safeguarding the Danish revolution by cracking down on the still wide antisyndicalist dissent; his opponents Alsing Andersen and Jørgen Jørgensen of the Stauninger and the liberals respectively, are against these tactics, arguing that it will only deepen the distrust of the Danes to the new system, which many view as imposed on Denmark."

 den.77.a:0 "No surprises there."
 den.78.t:0 "Liberal Victory"
 den.78.d:0 "The syndicalists have been beaten at their own game; the French allowed a more open system in Denmark because they believed that the small Radikale Venstre party would never become influential, but the exclusion of the conservatives and other liberals has obviously resulted in great gains for this previously small group. Some wonder whether the liberals who now took over this syndicalist trade union will institute a thaw when the other syndicalists stop watching."

Failing to pass the amendment could be a massive blow to our government."

This amounts to 48.9% of the electorate and with a ratio in favour of 91.9%, it means the percentage of the electorate supporting the amendment remained at 44.46%; just below the threshold of 45% needed to pass. Not only does it seem we'll have to do with the old constitution from 1916. Both Thorvald Stauning from the Socialdemokraterne and John Christmas Møller of the DKF have spoken out conceding their defeat and neither seems to be very happy with this outcome."

Both Thorvald Stauning and John Christmas Møller have expressed their approval with this outcome and it seems all but assured that the 1916 referendum will be replaced now!"

Having been switching between member of the government, primary leader of the opposition and even prime minister, he has surely pressed his mark onto Danish politics. Venstre has been swift to announce Knud Kristensen as the new leader of the party; it will surely be a challenging for him to match this illustrious leader of the Danish right."

Christiansen therefore decided to focus on smaller projects and started to produce toys for kids. While the process has not been extremely profitable, with most customers paying in kind, it has allowed the workshop to stay afloat and the toys - now being shipped under the brand 'Lego', a contraction of 'Leg godt', 'play well' - are growing in popularity throughout Denmark as well as in Schleswig-Holstein and profits are rising."

Not anymore, as we are at war with the current occupier of Slesvig, it is time to stake our claim once more. The people of Slesvig are eager to rejoin our nation!"
