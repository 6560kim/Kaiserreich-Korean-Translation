TEX_expand_the_minute_men:0 "미닛맨 확충"
TEX_expand_the_minute_men_desc:0 "우리 군의 충성도을 유지하기 위해서는 미닛맨를 시민 보호와 국경 감시 분야로 확대해야 합니다. 반항적인 사회주의자들과 맥아더 추종자들은 더 이상 교전 규칙을 지키지 않기 때문에, 우리는 그들의 잔학행위에도 어느 정도 대비해야 합니다. "
TEX_election_monitoring:0 "선거 감시"
TEX_election_monitoring_desc:0 "민주적 절차를 수행할 수 있는 유일한 힘은 투표지들을 위험으로부터 보호하기 위해 매년 11월에 배치될 미닛맨들입니다. 그들은 제3자로부터 투표 과정을 안전하게 보호하고 우리에게 아무런 문제가 없도록 할 것입니다."

TEX_destroy_the_klan_desc:0 "히람 웨슬리 에반스와 그의 KKK 생도들은 마침내 체포되어 그들의 테러행위로 재판에 회부되었습니다. 이 가장 위험한 역적들은 살인, 린치, 유권자들에 대한 협박을 저질렀습니다. 우리는 마침내 미국제일당을 독살하려는 극단적 세력과 그들의 신념을 저지했습니다."
TEX_ensure_loyalty:0 "충성심 확보"
TEX_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "의원들은 우리의 민주주의 체제에 대한 신뢰의 기준을 세우는 방법을 고안해냈습니다. 소위 '어류법'은 모든 정당 대표, 노조 지도자, 공무원이 노조연맹이나 맥아더 군정을 절대 돕지 않을 것이라는 서약서에 서명할 것을 요구합니다."
TEX_reward_loyalty:0 "충성심 보상"
TEX_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "어류법 비판자들은 공무원들이 그 서약서에 서명할 동기가 없다고 정당하게 발언했습니다. 이에 대응하여 연방주의자들에 의해 연기된 '내전 중 공공기관에서 보낸 시간에 대한 보상'을 제공하는 두 번째 법안이 통과되었습니다. 물론 이 보상은 앞서 언급한 서약서에 서명함을 전제로 합니다."
TEX_national_political_machine:0 "국가 정당 조직"
TEX_national_political_machine_desc:0 "과거에 행정권은 국가의 주권을 침해하지 않는 한에서 미국민을 위해 봉사하는 기관을 만드는 데 사용되어져 왔습니다. 또한 과거에는 기업의 이해관계로부터 이러한 권력이 부패로도 이어졌습니다. 그러나 휴이 롱은 부패하지 않습니다. 독점자와 사기꾼에 대해 밥상을 뒤엎는 것은 휴이의 약속된 미국입니다."
TEX_new_democracy:0 "신민주주의"
TEX_new_democracy_desc:0 "휴이 롱의 신(New)민주주의는 미국인들과 지도자 사이의 새로운 사회적 계약이라고 설명됩니다. 신민주주의는 역경을 통해, 심지어 폭력을 통해서도 유권자들의 이익에 기여할 정치인을 약속합니다. 모든 사람이 왕이 될 때까지, 유권자에게 충성하는 사람은 복이 있을 것입니다."
TEX_peoples_commission:0 "국민위원회"
TEX_peoples_commission_desc:0 "그의 고향인 루이지애나 주의 사법 지역에서 영감을 받아, 휴이 롱은 국민위원회라고 불리는 합법적인 대표 단체를 만들었습니다. 국민위원회는 제일당이 미국 국민들과 직접 소통하고 정치인들이 보고받지 못할 사항들을 청취할 수 있도록 하는 초당적인 공개 토론 포럼입니다."
TEX_every_man_a_king:0 "모든 사람이 왕이다"
TEX_every_man_a_king_desc:0 "오리슨 스웨트 마든의 책에서 동기가 부여돼 한낱 몽상으로 시작된 ‘모든 사람이 왕이다’는 이제 엄연한 정치적 현실이 되었습니다. 미국을 구할 대공황을 초래한 것은 긍정적인 사고와 비관적인 탐욕의 끝입니다. 휴이 롱의 경제 및 사회 계획에 따라 미국을 변화시키고 정치의 새 장을 엽니다."
TEX_for_the_poor_man:0 "빈자를 위하여"
TEX_for_the_poor_man_desc:0 "현재 휴이 롱은 평균 부의 1/3을 주거수당으로 제공하는 법안을 의회에 제출했습니다. 충성스런 미국인들에게 연간 2000달러의 보장된 수입과 노후연금이 분배될 준비가 되어 있습니다. 적절한 소득세가 만들어지기 전까지는 이러한 혜택이 국고로 충당될 것입니다."
TEX_populist_education:0 "대중을 위한 교육"
TEX_populist_education_desc:0 "이 위대한 나라에는 수백만 명의 아이들이 정상적인 삶을 재개하기 위해 고군분투하고 있으나 교육 받지 않은 부모들의 미래와 다를 바 없는 미래를 살게 될 것입니다. 롱 각하는 어려움에 처한 미국인들을 위해 의회가 통과시킨 법안을 승인하여 학교를 재건하고 대학을 재개장했습니다."
TEX_road_map_for_the_future:0 "미래를 향한 로드맵"
TEX_road_map_for_the_future_desc:0 "'모든 사람은 왕이다'에 사용되는 휴이 롱의 예산은 근본적으로 다른 세금 징수 수단의 확충과 공공 재정을 필요로 합니다. 따라서 롱 각하는 향후 4년간의 임기 동안 미국이 통과해야 할 이정표를 세울 로드맵을 마련했습니다."
TEX_national_youth_adminstration:0 "국가청년국"
TEX_national_youth_adminstration_desc:0 "내전의 고아들은 먹고살기 위한 교육뿐만 아니라 규율도 필요합니다. 오마하주 네브라스카 근처의 고아원 방문은 롱 각하가 국가청년국을 설립하는 계기가 되었습니다. 어린 미국인들을 위한 직업 훈련과 행동주의 소조는 고아들에게 삶의 터전을 마련해주고 인생을 살아가는데 있어서 중요한 기술들을 가르쳐줍니다."
TEX_share_the_wealth:0 "부를 공유하다"
TEX_share_the_wealth_desc:0 "미국을 내전에 빠지는 것을 도운 부자들이 피해를 배상할 때가 왔습니다. 그 누구도 연소득의 300배 이상을 축적하는 것이 허용되지 않을 것입니다. 소득의 상한선은 100만 달러, 상속의 상한선은 510만 달러입니다. 롱 각하는 자신을 비난한 언론들이 틀렸다는 것을 증명할 것입니다."
TEX_imperial_presidency:0 "제왕적 대통령직"
TEX_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "역적들이 드러나고 뿌리째 뽑히면서 여론조사는 롱 각하의 재선에 대한 압도적인 지지를 보여줍니다. 제일당 내의 회원들에게 복종하라는 압력이나 위협을 받지 않는 휴이 롱을 많은 사람들이 '제왕적 대통령'이라고 부르기 시작했습니다. 별 볼일 없는 사람이 책임질 때까지 재선 재한은 정중히 버려집니다."
TEX_fire_with_fire:0 "이열치열"
TEX_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "미국의 정치적, 사회적 적들에 대한 이념 투쟁은 지금까지 복지와 보조금이라는 형식으로 이루어졌습니다. 이제 롱 각하는 부의 공유에 대한 사회적 저항에 강력한 한 방을 날릴 준비가 되어있습니다. 우리는 국가라는 배가 전복되는 것을 막기 위해 가능한 모든 조치를 취해야 합니다."
TEX_perfect_democracy:0 "완벽한 민주주의"
TEX_perfect_democracy_desc:0 "첫 번째 헌법은 미국에 완전한 조합을 형성하기 시작했습니다. 이 조합은 실패했고, 미국은 죽었지만, 롱 각하 덕분에 부활했습니다. 휴이 롱과 미국인들은 헌법이 이제 더 완벽한 민주주의를 구축하기 위한 문서라는 것에 동의했습니다. 지도자에 의해 행사되는 미국인의 변함없는 의지 말입니다."
### George Van Horn Moseley Path ###
TEX_the_business_plot:0 "사업 구상회"
TEX_the_business_plot_desc:0 "In order to keep the reputation of the War Powers Committee away from the public eye, we have chosen to extend the facade of the 'Arsenal of the Republic' into the new America. The reborn American Republic will return to the fundamental values of our Founding Fathers, and clearly say to the world that America is a Republic, not a Democracy."
TEX_use_the_fbi:0 "FBI 활용"
TEX_use_the_fbi_desc:0 "J. Edgar Hoover understands the needs of the new American Republic to safeguard against syndicalists. Cooperation of the FBI is also popularly received as it signals stability. We can trust the FBI to look in all the wrong places for Huey Long. If J. Edgar ever steps out of line, his relationship with Clyde Tolson will be public knowledge."
TEX_alien_and_sedition_act:0 "새로운 이주법과 치안유지법"
TEX_alien_and_sedition_act_desc:0 "One of the most important acts of the early American Republic was the Aliens and Sedition Act passed by President John Adams, a wise statesman. We must revive the Act to protect true Americans from syndicalist infiltrators. Firstly, being a danger to public safety or national integrity is now grounds for imprisonment and deportation."
TEX_cointelpro:0 "코인텔프로"
TEX_cointelpro_desc:0 "새로운 이주법과 치안유지법의 성공은 우리가 그동안 알려진 생디칼주의자 구성원들을 비롯한 비정치적이고 종교적인 몇몇 조직들을 식별하는 것을 가능하게 했습니다. 이러한 조직은 조직 구성원 간의 통신을 감시할 수 있는 완전한 능력을 갖춘 최초의 역지능 프로그램인 새로운 코인텔프로 프로그램에 따라 감시될 것입니다."
TEX_purge_dissidents:0 "반체제 인사 숙청"
TEX_purge_dissidents_desc:0 "Through the Aliens and Sedition Act we have gathered a list of known enemies of the War Powers Committee. They are welfare Longists, anti-progress religious fundamentalists, and mutualists. We are prepared to arrest every ground member and have prepared to export certain as-of-yet untouchable politicians who support these dissidents."
TEX_office_of_policy_coordination:0 "정책조정실"
TEX_office_of_policy_coordination_desc:0 "The Office of Policy Coordination, or OPC, was proposed as a means to influence local politics in our favor through agent provocateurs, small scale sanctions, and directly sabotage. The OPC will enable us to softly muscle out radicals and indignant federalists that wish to re-enter the US government on their terms."
TEX_the_black_chamber:0 "검은 회의실"
TEX_the_black_chamber_desc:0 "Another safety objective is to revitalize the Black Chamber with something Vannevar Bush calls Memex. It is a hypothetical system that would be able to store and transmit microfilm and make information search-able from a station that is connected through telephone wire to other stations. This proposed plan could lead us to a golden age of security."
TEX_american_nationalism:0 "미국 국가주의"
TEX_american_nationalism_desc:0 "The American Dream, or Creed, or even Ideal is the often-described glue that holds together our national integrity and prevents civil disturbances. The cascade of failure that was epitomized by Hoover and turned over by Huey Long is now fertile for the American Republic to replant American Nationalism."
TEX_the_american_legion:0 "재향군인회"
TEX_the_american_legion_desc:0 "휴이 롱의 종말은 재향군인회의 용감한 참전용사들이 아니었다면 재앙으로 끝났을 것입니다. 대중의 히스테리가 생디칼주의자에 대항하여 커졌을 때 우뚝 서 있었던 것은 모즐리 아래의 재향군인회였습니다. 휴이 롱의 미닛맨 경호원들이 그가 실종되는 우회로를 택하도록 설득한 것도 재향군인회였습니다."
TEX_nationalize_boy_scouts:0 "보이스카우트 통제"
TEX_nationalize_boy_scouts_desc:0 "Patriotic youth organizations have existed in Europe for decades. Our own Boy Scouts of America are an untapped well of support for the American Republic to encourage loyalty in Americans subtlety. The War Powers Committee authorizes the appropriation of the Boy Scouts facility to educate and foster true Republicanism."
TEX_fordism:0 "포드주의"
TEX_fordism_desc:0 "Although scientific management was not invented by Henry Ford, it was Ford that proved that measuring time spent on work tasks could lead to faster and more efficient time management. To thank our Committee member Ford, we have granted him the intellectual property over the assembly line method, as well as promoted it in publications."

TEX_capitalist_education:0 "ESMWT 창설"
TEX_capitalist_education_desc:0 "The Engineering, Science, and Management War Training, or ESMWT, is the brainchild of the Department of Commerce to decentralize technological changes. Instead of cooperation that would disrupt competition and give an unfair advantage to certain businesses, this program disburses its findings freely to the public."
TEX_captains_of_industry:0 "산업 대장"
TEX_captains_of_industry_desc:0 "Without the noble self-sacrifice of the Captains of Industry, America would have been lost. We should push through Congress a new income tax bracket for those earning more than $10 million dollars annually. With many exceptions designed to give these useful industrialists tax breaks if they are engaged in philanthropy."
TEX_industrial_security_act:0 "산업보장법"
TEX_industrial_security_act_desc:0 "The need for work-site security has never been greater. The average working man is besieged by syndicalist infiltrators, Longist provocateurs, and federalist malcontents. We need to authorize the use of strikebreakers and integrate our loyal American Legionaries into the new National Guard so as to quickly respond to industrial sabotage."
TEX_pass_nira:0 "노동관계법"
TEX_pass_nira_desc:0 "A permanent solution to the labor crisis has presented itself in the form of then executive order by Moseley to set up a national labor relations bureau.

TEX_red_scare:0 "붉은 공포"
TEX_red_scare_desc:0 "The FBI has announced that after many months of searching for President Long, he can no longer be presumed alive. The uproar against any socialist groups remaining in America is enormous. The War Powers Committee can barely keep up with all the state laws being passed to stop socialism. Public approval for Moseley is at an all-time high."
TEX_traditional_values:0 "전통적 가치"
TEX_traditional_values_desc:0 "An address by President Moseley has denounced the changes of the last thirty years as the agenda of foreigners that sought to destroy America's industrious nature. The press is divided between those that know Moseley as an antisemitic canard and those who truly believe in the American Republic. Nevertheless, the public loves it."
TEX_republic_without_democracy:0 "민주주의 없는 공화국"
TEX_republic_without_democracy_desc:0 "The American public is now in agreement that Huey Long's true vision of America was that of a Republic without Democracy. Moseley's term has been extended for another four years due to the continued emergency that threatens the American continent. Americanism as the War Powers Committee sees it grows as the term oligarchy loses its stigma."

TEX_mine_have_seen_the_glory:0 "영광이 내 눈에 보이네"
TEX_mine_have_seen_the_glory_desc:0 "It took many Americans by surprise to hear Huey Long's confession of being a syndicalist broadcast that night. The initial backlash could have ended the brief revolution had the Silver Legion faltered. Thankfully, the American Legion and Prohibition Party had deserted Long after his betrayal of his promises. This is the beginning of a new America."
TEX_the_silver_legion:0 "은색 군단"
TEX_the_silver_legion_desc:0 "The Silver Legion is currently the unofficial head of the American Legion, with propaganda delivered slowly through agents. This has led to pockets of dissent in some American Legion outposts. We must identify these dissidents and redistribute them to far flung outposts in order to minimize their potential."
TEX_absorb_the_klan:0 "KKK 흡수"
TEX_absorb_the_klan_desc:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans has been officially inducted into the Silver Legion at a mass Klan gathering in the capital today. His word carries weight in the KKK and will be essential to reel in the Klan. We will also require that Klansmen no longer conceal their faces. In order to use the influence of members to the fullest extent."
TEX_crackdown_on_traitors:0 "반역자 소탕"
TEX_crackdown_on_traitors_desc:0 "A group of stubborn Klansman that refuse to reveal their names have come to Pelley seeking exception. Our Chief Pelley made an enlightened decision to this issue, and has sent the Klansmen into a Secret Service. With a portion of the Klan still undercover, we will be able to seek out and eliminate those with reservations against us."
TEX_covenant_sword_and_arm:0 "성경, 검, 갑주"
TEX_covenant_sword_and_arm_desc:0 "Members of the Silver Legion in the White Identity Church of Jesus Christ-Christian have reported that many local financial institutions in their area are controlled by syndicalists and foreigners. Since the Legion is overstretched, our Chief Pelley has authorized the Church to appropriate wealth from citizens whether willing or not."
TEX_camps_for_syndies:0 "생디칼리즘 불법화"
TEX_camps_for_syndies_desc:0 "The future of Syndicalism and Longism has been decided. Labor re-education and internment camps are authorized by the shell Congress to house suspected syndicalists indefinitely until the national emergency of the Civil War has truly ended. The American Legion has already begun to clear meeting houses and city councils of traitors."
TEX_forced_labor:0 "강제 노동"
TEX_forced_labor_desc:0 "The loss of one hundred thousand people from the labor market has angered what used to be loyal Legionaries. Debates in the once quiet halls of Congress are erupting to demand Pelley find a solution to the lack of able-bodied workers in America. Pelley's solution? Forced labor for traitors at the service of the corporation that is the Commonwealth."
TEX_jim_crows_america:0 "짐 크로의 미국"
TEX_jim_crows_america_desc:0 "The way of life in the South that the northerner Pelley found, that of segregation and state laws that prevented blacks from exercising civil rights, struck Pelley as the true soul of America. Finally, with total control and the world to gain by acting, Pelley has begun to suggest northern states pass Jim Crow laws of their own."
TEX_protecting_our_race:0 "우생학 부활"
TEX_protecting_our_race_desc:0 "The foundations of America as Pelley and Armstrong see it are connected not only to the former nation of Britain, but to Anglo Saxons as a race. An executive act by Pelley has illegalized inter-racial marriage, requiring all marriages to occur in Christian Identity churches, and the Silver Legion itself has been deployed to re-segregate schools."
TEX_segregation_forever:0 "영원한 분리"
TEX_segregation_forever_desc:0 "Our inability to stop protesters from returning each day despite the beatings and the bullets proved to be an intriguing challenge.

TEX_christian_commonwealth:0 "기독교 공동체"
TEX_christian_commonwealth_desc:0 "Pelley's grand vision of the American Commonwealth is a country free of debt and bonds by turning the entire government into a gigantic corporation. Inalienable rights are given, not promised to native born Americans in the form of stocks that pay annual dividend or 'credits' to citizens that vote on their Silver Legion representative."
TEX_white_welfare:0 "백인만을 위한 공공복지"
TEX_white_welfare_desc:0 "First order is to determine who is a true natural citizen and deserving of stock in the Common-wealth.

TEX_christian_education:0 "기독교 교육"
TEX_christian_education_desc:0 "Harvard's Divinity School should have been the gold standard for education since its inception. The education of Christians is essential to the Silver Legion's long life, and to do that we should fund divinity schools across the nation in the Harvard Model. Introspection into the secrets of Christianity will stop syndicalist thought."
TEX_christian_identity:0 "기독교 정체성"
TEX_christian_identity_desc:0 "What began as an offshoot of Anglo-Israelism in Canada has grown into a concrete political and social doctrine under the Pelley-Armstrong line. Christian Identity envisions a union of German-Assyrians, Afro-Americans, Socialists, Jewish people, and Catholics that are all in a confederation against them. Now the public shall know of this danger."
TEX_church_and_state:0 "교회와 국가"
TEX_church_and_state_desc:0 "There are implicit religious values within America that only the Silver Legion can see. It is obvious to the Silver Legion and the Pelley-Armstrong line that America was meant to be ruled by only pious Protestant Christians. Therefore, Chief Pelley has recognized Christianity as the official religion of the American Commonwealth."
TEX_christian_service_brigade:0 "기독교 서비스 여단"
TEX_christian_service_brigade_desc:0 "What began as a volunteer organization for young boys during the Civil War has now become a nationally funded organization, The Christian Service Brigade.

TEX_citzens_council:0 "백인 의회"
TEX_citzens_council_desc:0 "The legacy of civil disobedience that shook the 1930s has stayed with the members of the White Citizens Council. The White Citizens Council has taken up the torch to intimidate voters and discourage citizen stockholders meetings from pushing for integration. Pelley has subtlety increased the common share of the White Citizens Council in response."
TEX_christian_work_ethic:0 "기독교 노동관"
TEX_christian_work_ethic_desc:0 "With the advent of the Commonwealth, there begins a split in work ethic across the nation that the Silver Legion did not intend. Blue Laws that used to allow Christian time off of work to go to church are being revoked as by those who do not value the morals of the nation. We must bring Blue Laws back."
TEX_america_is_born_again:0 "미국은 다시 태어났다"
TEX_america_is_born_again_desc:0 "Many doubted the ability for the Silver Legion to succeed Huey Long, but those that took the risk are now enjoying the fruits of America's credit system and renewed faith. Huey Long's legacy is that of blindness and deception that gave way to Pelley's truth. What remains to be seen is what the foreign conspirators will do next. "
### Reconstruction ###

TEX_rebuilding_the_country_desc:0 "A long struggle to push through the Federalist and Syndicalist forces in America has left the victorious Union State economically drained.

TEX_research_projects:0 "국가교육국"
TEX_research_projects_desc:0 "In the wake of the collapse of the CSA, the National Education Association has folded and its members dispersed.

TEX_civil_works_adminstration:0 "토목사업국"
TEX_civil_works_adminstration_desc:0 "As a nation, America lost a great deal of its labor supply to fighting and the poverty of the disorganized Federalists.

TEX_farm_security_administration:0 "농업안정국"
TEX_farm_security_administration_desc:0 "Sharecroppers and tenant farmers make up a significant portion of our constituency, especially in the core power of the South.

TEX_begin_reconstruction:0 "재건 시작"

TEX_harsh_reconstruction_desc:0 "Congress has sided with us in condemning these companies that betrayed the American people.

TEX_business_subsides:0 "규제 완화"
TEX_business_subsides_desc:0 "The dual-layered federal government system had allowed for at times very loose regulations on workspace practice, depending on the state. In order to leverage this inherent balance in our government, we must allow businesses both large and small to thrive."
TEX_building_grants:0 "건설 보조금"
TEX_building_grants_desc:0 "Smaller townships across America have no recourse if their need is slightly less than the threshold for contract work. Our remedy is a Building Grant program based off of the Ford Foundation. This allows communities to show proper need and return on investment for contract work."
TEX_banking_act:0 "기업 군국주의"
TEX_banking_act_desc:0 "Many businesses closed or were temporarily forced to leave America when union activity reached a pitched frenzy.

TEX_american_business_is_business:0 "미국의 사업은 바쁘다"
TEX_american_business_is_business_desc:0 "As most of Congress is fiscally conservative, it was easy to pass laws reorganizing the newly named National Reserve to stop deflation.

TEX_create_esmwt:0 "연구 투자"
TEX_create_esmwt_desc:0 "As we revitalize research labs and think tanks across the nation, we have also begun to spread highly rewarding research grants that have laid dormant during the Civil War.

TEX_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "The course of reconstruction has revealed the true ideological basis for why Hoover was unable to fix the economy.

TEX_military_industry:0 "군사 산업"
TEX_military_industry_desc:0 "The main trouble with creating a military industry is that facilities under our control were already reduced from the Great Depression to reduce redundancies.

TEX_we_can_do_it_desc:0 "Positivism is one tool of motivation Huey Long has taught us. Several of our harsher generals have reluctantly allowed positivist pamphlets and entertainment into the barracks. Decades of derision in American soldiers melts away when told that every soldier can be a hero."
TEX_trained_officers:0 "훈련된 장교"
TEX_trained_officers_desc:0 "We have made the bold decision to train Officers in the hostile swampland of Parris Island. Classrooms may not be as well-equipped as West Point, but our officers will receive an education in hard knocks that will prove America's worth more than its refinement."
TEX_new_training:0 "신무기"
TEX_new_training_desc:0 "Our storage of prototype firearms from the 1919 trials have been recovered and are being generously donated to manufacturers. We must be able to at least match designs with that the Federal Army has already considered in the past."

TEX_auto_industry_desc:0 "Since the invention of the Automobile, it has been taken up with earnest by the people of America.

TEX_shock_and_awe:0 "충격과 공포"

While the War Powers Committee leads several multinational corporations, we have noticed a strong uptick in domestic sales that could remove the risk of retreating from foreign markets. It is time for the Committee to settle this national debate. "

A proposal from Congress may be able to remedy this. The original American Plan was legislation proposed during the Wilson administration to guarantee employers ability to challenge Union activities. The foolish Congress under McAdoo failed to properly ensure this right, but the new American Republic will correct that.

The fear that the political spotlight the War Powers Committee is in by holding Cabinet positions has two possible solutions. The first is to coordinate with Congress to push through a law to reorganize the Presidential Cabinet to officially become the War Powers Committee. The second is to appoint several of our loyalist politicians from Congress to appease prying eyes and keep the stability our new American Republic needs. Either way, our executive power is still secure. "

unionstate.51.d:0 "It began in the Meeting Halls of the Silver Legion, the idea that vaccines were a Syndicalist plot to poison America. This coupled with a belief that America's public water has been poisoned by fluoride and the dangers of sanitariums has propelled many a new politician into office. None higher than former Congressman Clare Hoffman, who has gained a following within the Silver Legion. This has even led to the AFP ending Dr. Maurice Brodie's polio vaccine research, which we could really have used. Now the summer heat has brought with it the largest Polio outbreak in American history. Although Clare is now out of office now and the American Public Health Association has been rehabilitated, the damage is still done. Many Americans are now permanently crippled."

In the outskirts of L.A, this compound was built a ranch to sustain the Silver Legion in case of a Syndicalist victory. Murphy Ranch as it is called now has the ability to become fully operational. Should we continue to fortify the homestead to protect our new Californian brothers? Or should we convert the land into a workplace for our reborn American industry?"

unionstate.53.d:0 "Although only known to the highest ranking members of The Silver Legion, there is a hidden depth in the mind of our Chief Pelley. To his closest friends, Pelley is more than a leader and a friend, he is their political, religious, and moral guide. Until now a sort of secret doctrine has been hidden from the public at large due to their unwillingness to accept that religious and temporal authority are one in the same. Now that our enlightened leader is well accepted in this brave new American society, should we go open with some of his more.....esoteric ideas? Pelley's handlers as it is can barely keep him from exposing his deeper thoughts to the public. Is the mystery of Pelley enough for the history books?"

unionstate.54.d:0 "Silver Legion representatives have done their best when recruiting to screen for religious beliefs, but our new recruits have propagated new beliefs that does not fit the Pelley-Armstrong line. One group out in California called Mankind United claims that America's savior is thier local minister. Another has insinuated that we are willing to assist the Catholic nations in liberation. The potential threat to our power is limited, but at the same time disunity breeds insurance. The Silver Legion leadership is divided as to whether these ideas are dangerous or not enough to stamp out. What are we to do about these outrageous claims?"

unionstate.56.d:0 "Our Chief Pelley was surprised when the Roman Catholic Charles Coughlin came into the Silver Legion offices to offer his service to The Commonwealth. His position has been tenuous since then, as our former Klansmen continue to monitor the publication of Social Justice. Today however is different, now that his radio show's time slot has been taken by more important public services. His position as Chief Propagandist is effectively open. To whom should the post go to? To the very useful Herbert W Armstrong? To the loyal Richard Butler? or to an old American Firster Gerald L.K.

unionstate.58.d:0 "Today famed author William Faulkner's seminal work The Sound and The Fury releases in theaters to critical acclaim. Most reviewers have praised the exaltation of the Compson family by the prodigal son Jason. In the film Jason sacrifices his hard earned wealth to save his brother Benjy from a lifetime of pain, and saves his family's honor by sending his brother Quentin away to the barren North. Disaster strikes him when his niece Miss Quentin defrauds the family fortune and leaves town. Some critics have commented that the film is facetious and actually highlights the flaws in the Compson family and thus Southern society as a whole. Supporters of this interpretation cite author William Faulkner's liberal leanings, but those reviews were all published by known malcontents. "

unionstate.59.d:0 "The wave of public education changes implemented by Pelley in order to solidify Christian Identity into the America youth is nearly complete. his final act which passed with unanimous approval by the shell of Congress is the Black Education Act. The Black Education Act totally redefines education practices for ethnic minority communities and in particular African-Americans. Notably it focused the education of African-Americans for their role as labors and distances themselves from older notions of religious unity across races. As part of his speech announcing the law, he famously stated, 'There is no place for the Negro in the Anglo Saxon community above the level of laborer. What is the use of teaching the Negro child mathematics when it cannot use it in practice?'. "

At least on paper the Silver Legion claims these areas will be administered by African-Americans under the regime's jurisdiction, similar to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Moreover the Act would strip citizenship and any previous common-wealth to African-Americans nationwide. However, there comes even from our loyal members murmurs that a whites within the Black Belt would also lose their rights. What shall become of this act?"

A new order passed by the shell Congress has increased the sentence time for moral crimes and provided for more use of indentured labor in industry, thus being named the Penal Act. This Penal Labor has been given boost by reviving various Black Codes that criminalize attempting to vote as an African-American.

Groups like the International Labor Defense and the NAACP are now working together with the Red Cross to evacuate the masses of people struggling to remain free. To the Silver Legion and their leaders, this plays into a longstanding fear of a united front against their rule. At the same time, the fewer the dissidents internally the safer loyal Legionaries can sleep. The question is what shall we do. Shall we let them leave or shall we keep them here? "

unionstate.64.d.mexico:0 "The existence of American refugees in Mexico has generally been ignored by the Central Government, as we have had amicable relations with America in the past. However, this Pelley is a threat to the entire continent, and the thousands more refugees crossing the Rio Grande tell of the Silver Legion's horrors. These refugees are far different from the Ambrose Bierce's' looking to retire, they are scarred and determined to end the Legionary regime of America. "

A common story to tell was that the first Haitian was a refugee of Ethiopia that ran with such force that he only stopped when he fell into Haiti. Now we see this again coming out of the USA. The sinister Pelley should not have the right to do this to American people! We feel the refugees outrage, at the same time we struggle to determine whether our fragile economy can handle a labor surplus of this magnitude."
unionstate.64.d.cuba:0 "Just a 300 mile boat trip separated the thousands of American refugees from Cuba. Families in Cuba have been calling for months to their families to escape the very real threat of a nationalist takeover. None of them anticipated that the bottleneck in Florida would be opened all at once, causing hundreds of boats to show up at Varadero today. The flood of refugees from America has clogged up our ports, tied up or landlines, and put strain on the government ministry to respond. What should be our answer?"

We can only keep such good tabs on the so-called Commonwealth because trade with them is good, and now those trading ships have stowaways. These arrivals tell tales of burning towns and rampant pillaging by the Silver Legion that forced them to evacuate the continent to Hawaii. We may have issues handling the immigration process from a legal standpoint as well, so we must decide the fate of these American passengers. "

### Military Research ###

unionstate.101.t:0 "미래전"
unionstate.101.d:0 "After a long reshuffling of former US departments, the American Union State has uncovered old classified weapons proposals. The two proposals that caught the most interest are ones authored by Robert Goddard and Vannevar Bush, each proposing an expensive weapon project to deter invasions. Fortunately, both men were recovered from their respective hiding places, and persuaded into updating their proposals. Goddard's plan is for a liquid fuel rocket to deliver stable explosive payloads across long distances. Vannevar Bush's is a theoretical utilization of nuclear fission to create a bomb based on experiments done in Europe. Which plan should we pursue?"

unionstate.102.d:0 "After months of testing in the Southwest, and publishing several classified papers, the first test launch is prepared. In a fenced off area outside White Sands, New Mexico, Goddard's rocket stands ready. The rocket's design incorporates liquid fuel and stabilizers devised by Goddard with flight mechanics devised by Lindbergh Aircraft. At the head is a lower tonnage explosive meant to detonate after a set amount of time spent flying. A successful arc and explosion turns the New Mexico skyline on fire."

unionstate.103.d:0 "Hurdle after hurdle stood in between the American Union State and atomic weaponry. It began with a dearth of willing physicists and nuclear experts including Robert Oppenheimer who has yet to be located. Several other potential candidates signed a Humanist Declaration of pacifism abroad declaring their opposition to our program. Therefore, Bush has had to resort to industrial technicians which extended the timeline. Finally, after much testing and assistance from George Kistiakowsky, the first atomic bomb is tested. Due to the extensive safety precautions take, the vital test yielded an impressive blast but poor documentation."
