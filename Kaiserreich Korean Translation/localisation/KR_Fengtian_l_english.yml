#Unused Loc:
#Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Fengtian, known as the 'Three Eastern Provinces' during the Qing and Beiyang periods, were split into nine smaller sub-divisions in 1931 to aid governance and economic planning. The vast majority of Fengtian's industry and mineral wealth is concentrated in the South, while the central and Northern provinces are primarily agricultural. Jehol, to the Southwest of Liaoning Province, remained untouched by the reorganisation, but has suffered thanks to the end of rail traffic through the Liaoxi Corridor, which connected land transportation between Beijing and the Northeast. Thanks to the government's new initiatives incentivising development across the provinces, prosperity will surely increase, but serious structural issues remain, and may become problematic as a result of increasing disparity in development between the north and south.

#The 'Huanghanhui', or 'Imperial Han Society', have been found to be using bribes and threats of violence to coerce low-level members of the Assembly. Unfortunately this information has gone public, even as the Assemblymen in question have been removed from office, and local police pursue additional suspects.\n\nShortly after information regarding this incident was presented to Japanese authorities, Kempeitai agents were observed entering an enclosed compound outside Shenyang, and reports indicate gunfire was exchanged. Over a dozen bodies were removed from the premises, and it would be unwise to pursue this matter any further."

#"The Imperial Han Society, a secret society with a Han-chauvinistic ideology and uncompromising hate of other ethnicities, is believed to be behind a number of killings in Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin. The targets appear to be more or less random, linked only by their status as ethnic Russians, Manchu, Koreans, and Japanese. Mantetsu and the Japanese Consulate are demanding investigations, and the Kempeitai have already carted away a number of suspects to an unknown fate."

FNG_Regionalist_Sentiment:0 "지역주의자들의 불만"
FNG_Regionalist_Sentiment_desc:0 "우리 정부의 중국 통일이라는 목표는 항상 지역주의 이념과 충돌해왔는데, 정치에 무관심한 대다수 국민들은 통일된 중화민국이라는 이상보다도 봉천 지역이 우선이라는 지역주의를 더 선호합니다. 비록 장쭤린이 지도자가 되기 위해 지역주의자들의 논리에 편승하긴 했었으나 지금, 이 지역주의로 인해 만리장성 남부로 진출하여 베이징을 수복하고 중국을 재통일하는 원대한 계획이 틀어질 위기에 처했습니다."

Mantetsu has long maintained a series of privately run schools originally intended for the sons and daughters of employees, as well as Japanese immigrants, which pride themselves on providing an education comparable to or even exceeding those available in the Home Islands. At our behest, the Japanese government might pressure Mantetsu to open these to the public and provide staff to fill temporary shortages.\n\nOnce we open the door to this kind of activity it will be very difficult to close, and these schools will almost certainly be used to spread Japanese culture and norms.

fengtian.13.d:0 "With the reorganisation of the Northeast Transportation Committee complete, several new railways have been proposed for construction and, in some cases, completion. The first major project is the Jilin-Hailong Railway, originally planned in 1927, which met serious delays due to the eruption of war in the south, and Japanese attempts to stall construction. The line has been operating in a limited capacity since 1931 but remains incomplete, with a collection of smaller Chinese companies vying for the contract to continue building.\n\nThese companies, in the abscence of Mantetsu and Japanese engineers, will do a great deal to demonstrate Chinese strength and independence."

The line has been operating in limited capacity since 1931, but remains incomplete, with both Mantetsu and a collection of smaller Chinese companies vying for the contract to continue building.\n\nThe Japanese claim, and perhaps correctly, that they could have the railway complete in half the time due to their resources and expertise, but choosing a Chinese company would do a great deal to demonstrate Chinese strength and independence."
fengtian.13.a:0 "Choose a Chinese Company."
fengtian.13.b:0 "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.14.t:0 "The Jilin-Hailong Line is Complete"
fengtian.14.d:0 "After months of construction and various unfortunate delays, the Jilin-Hailong line is finally complete, extending the reach of our main rail system into areas otherwise difficult to access. After reviewing plans and available resources, the NTC will undoubtedly prepare to issue another contract."
fengtian.14.a:0 "Great news!"
fengtian.15.t:0 "Building the Changchun-Dailai Line"
fengtian.15.d:0 "The NTC's next major project is the Changchun-Dalai Line, which was originally proposed by the Japanese to connect Mantetsu's smaller provincial lines with central lines running through major cities. This work in particular serves a strategic purpose, as it should ease the movement of men and materials from north to south significantly."
fengtian.15.d_jap:0 "The NTC's next major project is the Changchun-Dalai Line, which was originally proposed by the Japanese to connect Mantetsu's smaller provincial lines with central lines running through major cities. This work in particular serves a strategic purpose, as it should ease the movement of men and materials from North to South significantly. While the line does have Japanese origins and would serve to extend Mantetsu's reach, NTC planners nonetheless note its practical value. As before, Mantetsu offers to carry out the construction process themselves, but Chinese companies stand ready to perform the same task."
fengtian.15.a:0 "Choose a Chinese Company."
fengtian.15.b:0 "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.16.t:0 "The Changchun-Dailai Line is Complete"
fengtian.16.d:0 "The new Changchun-Dailai line now stands among the most modern in China, taking full advantage of more recent technologies, and visually demonstrating the sheer gap in time between the older lines originating in the 1920s. Truly, the Northeast is moving toward a brighter future."
fengtian.16.a:0 "Excellent!"
fengtian.17.t:0 "Building the Taonan-Suolun Line"
fengtian.17.d:0 "The last of the NTC's major construction projects is the Taonan-Suolun Line which, like other recent projects, serves to connect major lines to otherwise difficult to reach areas. Unlike the previous line, however, this will connect directly to the Chinese Eastern Railway."
fengtian.17.d_jap:0 "The last of the NTC's major construction projects is the Taonan-Suolun Line which, like other recent works, serves to connect major lines to otherwise difficult to reach areas. Unlike the previous line, however, this will connect directly to the Chinese Eastern Railway, theoretically keeping Mantetsu's creeping influence further from its operations. All the same, Mantetsu offers to construct the railroad, likely hoping to salvage at least something from the situation."
fengtian.17.a:0 "Choose a Chinese Company."
fengtian.17.b:0 "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.18.t:0 "The Taonan-Suolun Line is Complete"
fengtian.18.d:0 "With the completion of the Taonan-Suolin Line, the Northeast Transportation Commission can focus on smaller projects, and on ensuring that China's railways remain Chinese. This second task will undoubtedly be a challenge all to itself."
fengtian.18.a:0 "Wansui!"
fengtian.19.t:0 "Railway Construction Workers Strike!"
fengtian.19.d:0 "Chinese workers, complaining of inadequate pay and difficult working conditions, have refused to return to work in a carefully coordinated strike. Despite the presence of railway unions in the Northeast, their coordination in this instance suggests the involvement of the Communications Clique, possibly as part of an attempt to demonstrate their influence or retaliate for some perceived slight.\n\nWhile this turn of events effects them too, the Japanese are happy to watch us squabble amongst ourselves. The strike will end, but not without causing significant delays."
fengtian.19.a:0 "Unfortunate."
fengtian.20.t:0 "Delays Plague Railway Construction"
fengtian.20.d:0 "The nature of the situation was fairly clear as soon as the first signs appeared; shipments unaccountably missing, rails laid at just enough of an incorrect angle to require complete re-construction, and sudden inspections of the labour force by Japanese agents supposedly seeking 'dangerous criminals'; inspections which inevitably required the suspension of work.\n\nThese same tactics were employed by the Japanese during the 1920s against the Fengtian Clique's railway projects, attempting to slow and discredit Chinese construction in order to limit competition to Mantetsu, and now they seem to be delaying our efforts once again. Unfortunately, there is little we can do."
fengtian.20.a:0 "Frustrating."
fengtian.21.t:0 "Delays Plague Mantetsu Railway Construction"
fengtian.21.d:0 "Despite Mantetsu's excellent engineers and equipment, the current railway construction project has encountered repeated delays as workers unaccountably go missing, materials vanish in the night, and bandits raid the camps alongside the rails, only to disappear before Japanese troops arrive.\n\nThe local police and our intelligence services are unwilling to do much to investigate or solve these repeated incidents, instead preferring to watch the Japanese squirm. The fact that Mantetsu received the contract to build the railway is well known to the public, and some patriotic citizens appear to have taken matters into their own hands."
fengtian.21.a:0 "What a pity."
#Imperial Fury/Japanese Aid Cut
fengtian.22.t:0 "Imperial Fury"
fengtian.22.d:0 "Infuriated, the Japanese government today issued a statement declaring an end to various Fengtian aid programs, including sectors such as research, industrial development, agricultural development, and military armament. The aid should return in some time, as the Japanese cannot afford to let us grow too weak, but until then many functions of our state are crippled."
fengtian.22.d_influence_low:0 "Worried by the decreasing power of their political proxy in the Assembly, the Japanese government today issued a statement declaring an end to various Fengtian aid programs, including sectors such as research, industrial development, agricultural development, and military armament. The aid should return in some time, as the Japanese cannot afford to let us grow too weak, but until then many functions of our state are crippled."
fengtian.22.d_fengtian_refuses_food:0 "Incensed by what they see as impertinence, the Japanese government today issued a statement declaring an end to various Fengtian aid programs, including sectors such as research, industrial development, agricultural development, and military armament. The aid should return in some time, as the Japanese cannot afford to let us grow too weak, but until then many functions of our state are crippled."
fengtian.22.d_fengtian_blames_japan:0 "Incensed by our 'grave insolence', the Japanese government today issued a statement declaring an end to various Fengtian aid programs, including sectors such as research, industrial development, agricultural development, and military armament. The aid should return in some time, as the Japanese cannot afford to let us grow too weak, but until then many functions of our state are crippled."
fengtian.22.a:0 "A hard lesson."
fengtian.22.b:0 "A perfect time to strike!"
fengtian.23.t:0 "Japanese Aid Returns"
fengtian.23.d:0 "Apparently feeling that their lesson in obedience is clear and punishing enough, the Japanese have resumed their aid. We should be careful about provoking them in the future, and make sure not to push the Concordia Association too far out of the Assembly before we are ready."
fengtian.23.a:0 "At last!"
#Clearing Investment Dearth
fengtian.24.t:0 "Wu Jinglian Criticises Japan"
fengtian.24.d:0 "Citing the recent expansion of the Japanese military garrison in Shenyang, Wu Jinglian launched a scathing criticism of Japan and its foreign policy from the Assembly floor. Though other politicians have been known to disparage the Japanese in the past, the post of Foreign Minister gives Wu's words a different kind of significance, and elevates them above the confines of the Assembly.\n\nWasting no time, the Japanese Consul-General has already demanded that we remove Minister Wu from office."
fengtian.24.a:0 "Oh dear."
fengtian.24.b:0 "Japan is our fraternal ally..."
fengtian.25.t:0 "Japanese Investment in Glass, Paper, and Textiles"
fengtian.25.d:0 "Thanks to our financial incentives, representatives of the Mitsui Zaibatsu have indicated a willingness to invest heavily in local businesses, specifically Dongxing Dye & Textile Company, Fengtian Industrial Paper, and Manchurian Glass. With controlling shares in all three companies, Mitsui seems likely to dominate our glass, paper, and textile industries for the foreseeable future, with only Mantetsu as competition."
fengtian.25.a:0 "Good news."
fengtian.25.b:0 "Block the investment."
fengtian.26.t:0 "Japanese Investment in Shipping and Tourism"
fengtian.26.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of its Yamato Hotel line, Mantetsu has actively promoted tourism in Fengtian, drawing wealthy and middle class tourists from the Home Islands to travel about Manchuria's 'exotic landscape' on its state of the art railways. In all that time, however, it has never extended its tourist ambitions to the sea.\n\nA small group of wealthy investors from Tokyo now intend to partner with several local shipping companies and establish a water-borne alternative to Mantetsu's railway tourism, while performing shipping services on the side, thus creating 'Bohai Waterborne Enterprises'.\n\nNone of this would be possible withour our efforts to encourage Sino-Japanese business partnership."
fengtian.26.a:0 "Good news."
fengtian.26.b:0 "Block the investment."
fengtian.27.t:0 "Japanese Investment in Metals and Minerals"
fengtian.27.d:0 "After talks with government representatives, the Sumitomo Zaibatsu has agreed to partially fund metals and mineral prospecting across Fengtian, in return for a proportional share in any companies created to extract any resources discovered. With rumors of gold in the Khigan Mountains and Tungsten in Liaoning Province, their investment seems likely to pan out."
fengtian.27.a:0 "Good news."
fengtian.27.b:0 "Block the investment."
fengtian.28.t:0 "Japanese Investment in Steel"
fengtian.28.d:0 "Mantetsu has long held Anshan Iron & Steel, China's largest steel processing company, as its subsidiary, and with recent government funded expansion of the Anshan Mines and an atmosphere ripe for investment, it has decided to invest further capital in modernising and expanding the company's operations."
fengtian.28.a:0 "Good news."
fengtian.28.b:0 "Block the investment."
fengtian.29.t:0 "Wu Jinglian Negotiates New Trade terms"
fengtian.29.d:0 "The Qing-German embargo on goods moving to and from the Northeast hit its economy hard. Recovery came largely as a product of trade handled with the Legation Cities as an intermediary, allowing the embargo to be sidestepped, but at the cost of additional tariffs and reliance on third parties. With Shanghai businesses, both legitimate and illegitimate, fully aware of their control over an entire region's trade, trade deals have always been lacklustre despite their necessity.\n\nSomehow Wu Jinglian has managed to push through years of negotiations however, and secured a deal offering better terms for trade. Rumours swirl that a number of palms were greased in the process, but nobody seems to want to ask questions."
fengtian.29.a:0 "Excellent!"
fengtian.30.t:0 "Chinese Investment in Industrial Materials"
fengtian.30.d:0 "Encouraged by our investment incentives, and worried by Japanese dominance of Fengtian's heavy industry sector, several wealthy businessmen with ties to the Communications Clique have pooled their resources to invest heavily in several promising companies in Jinzhou, namely Zhaozin Ceramics Company, Jinzhou Railway Machinery, and the Northeastern Chemical Leather Plant."
fengtian.30.a:0 "Good news."
fengtian.30.b:0 "Block the investment."
fengtian.31.t:0 "Chinese Investment in Heilongjiang"
fengtian.31.d:0 "With Japanese investment often flooding into heavy industry and mining, a group of local investors have decided to pool their resources in order to back two Chinese companies struggling against Mantetsu competition. The Dongdai Fertiliser company and Shanjing Packing Plant will both continue to help Fengtian's burgeoning soy industry expand into the Northeastern frontier."
fengtian.31.a:0 "Good news."
fengtian.31.b:0 "Block the investment."
fengtian.32.t:0 "A New Automobile Company"
fengtian.32.d:0 "Thanks to the Shenyang Arsenal's regular production of the Minsheng Truck and our efforts to encourage sino-japanese cooperation, a group of Communications Clique oligarchs have partnered with the Jidosha-Seizo Company, subsidiary to the Nihon Sangyo Zaibatsu, to fund the creation of a new automobile factory in Liaoning Province. Already a collection of young engineers, mostly educated in Japan, are studying the prospects of more modern consumer-oriented Minsheng-inspired models."
fengtian.32.a:0 "Good news!"
fengtian.32.b:0 "Block the investment."
fengtian.33.t:0 "An End to the Investment Shortage"
fengtian.33.d:0 "After roughly a decade of limited external or internal investment beyond the government's own, Fengtian has made itself a reliable and trustworthy location for prosperous growth. Going from strength to strength, and with the fires of industry behind us, our prospects of retaking the country are growing by the day.\n\nAs we begin other development projects, we should begin to see our investment efforts open up related opportunities."
fengtian.33.a:0 "Finally!"
#The Hiroshima Proposal
fengtian.34.t:0 "Red Spears in Cangzhou!"
fengtian.34.d:0 "Bands of Red Spears, peasant self-defense units which are often little better than bandits, have grown in size and strength across Cangzhou recently, especially along the Zhili-Shandong border. As the new rulers in the area, we are expected to maintain peace and order, which has now been substantially disturbed. Several local garrisons have been attacked, villages burned, and towns raided. Forces have already been dispatched to deal with the issue, but a concerted effort to wipe out resistance in the rear areas, behind our front lines, is likely needed to deal with them permanently."
fengtian.34.a:0 "Damn pesants!"
fengtian.35.t:0 "Deserters Rise up in Daming!"
fengtian.35.d:0 "When our troops swept through Zhili province, they crushed all signs of organized resistance, but sometimes resistance isn't so organized. Groups of deserters, stemming from our enemy's former armies and our own forces, have begun organizing in order to take on larger targets across Daming. Several trains in the vicinity of Shimen have come under attack, and have caused our logisticians serious concern due to the Jinhan Line's major strategic importance. Local garrisons will be mobilized to deal with the issue, but matters such as these behind our lines deserve a coordinated response."
fengtian.35.a:0 "Traitors the lot of them!"
fengtian.36.t:0 "Warlords Resist in Ruyang"
fengtian.36.d:0 "Composed as they are of informal patronage networks, not all local power structures can be co-opted by our occupying forces. In this case, several local warlords formerly loyal to Wu Peifu have seemingly taken offense at our policies in Ruyang, and seized the Gongxian Arsenal at Xinyang. Despite their relative organization and weapons from the arsenal, their troops are still too few and too ill-equipped to combat our own on a large scale, but they will nontheless force us to divert forces away from the front lines. We need a coherent response to these cases of resistance."
fengtian.36.a:0 "Fools."
fengtian.37.t:0 "Bandits Sweep Guanzhong"
fengtian.37.d:0 "The mountains around Xi'an have been home to bandits since time immemorial, but now these brigands have come down from the hills and begun preying on hapless travelers, undefended villages, and most importantly our supply caravans. Due to their diffuse and disorganized nature, bandits can be difficult to track down and eliminate permanently. To do so we will undoubtedly need a coordinated effort."
fengtian.37.a:0 "Well what are we waiting for?"

#Soy Agricultural Initiative
fengtian.42.t:0 "The Soy Agricultural Initiative"
fengtian.42.d:0 "Soybeans are an extremely flexible crop, useful for human food, animal feed, fertiliser, and for a wide variety of industrial applications. Mantetsu's Research Wing has made great strides in making their growing, processing, and use more efficient, but planting percentages across Fengtian remain relatively stagnant. Korean farmers, who make up the majority of immigrants to Manchuria, are excellent rice planters, and like many Chinese prefer crops they have more experience with.\n\nIn an attempt to change this, Mantetsu began the Soy Agricultural Initiative, a plan intending to educate farmers and incentivise the production of soy as a cash crop, but it has so far been poorly received. Mantetsu hopes to gain the government's support in promoting the initiative, which would almost certainly increase soy yields and therefore long term profits.\n\nA few dissenting voices have pointed out that excessive soy production could reduce food security in the northeast, and in the right conditions might lead to a famine."
fengtian.42.a:0 "Back the Initiative."
fengtian.42.b:0 "We need no more soy."
fengtian.43.t:0 "Japan and Korea Struggle with Drought"
fengtian.43.d_fengtian_forced:0 "Both Japan and Korea are experiencing severe drought conditions, which we have fortunately been spared, but their economies and people now suffer, and some live on the brink of starvation. The Japanese government has formally demanded that we take part in a programme wherein we provide rice and millet to Korea, which in turn will provide rice to Japan. However, this plan is somewhat confounded by the overwhelming success of Mantetsu's Soy Agricultural Initiative, which replaced vast tracts of rice plots with soy farming. As a result, we have nowhere near enough rice and millet to feed Korea, while our soy production remains key to our industry and international trade.\n\nThanks to Japan's political and economic influence, we have little choice but to comply."
fengtian.43.d_fengtian_normal:0 "Both Japan and Korea are experiencing severe drought conditions, which we have fortunately been spared, but their economies and people now suffer, and some live on the brink of starvation. The Japanese government has informally asked that we take part in a programme wherein we provide rice and millet to Korea, which in turn will provide rice to Japan. However, this plan is somewhat confounded by the overwhelming success of Mantetsu's Soy Agricultural Initiative, which replaced vast tracts of rice plots with soy farming. As a result, we have nowhere near enough rice and millet to feed Korea, while our soy production remains key to our industry and international trade.\n\nThis is a surprising turn for the typically aloof Japanese, but all the same, while we may refuse, it would almost certainly be met with severe repercussions."
fengtian.43.a:0 "We will provide food."
fengtian.43.b:0 "Japan is on its own."
fengtian.44.t:0 "Food departs for Korea"
fengtian.44.d:0 "With Japan's proposal accepted, provisions are leaving from Yingkou for Incheon and other ports in Korea, as well as along the Anfeng and Gyeongui lines to Pyongyang. While starvation has yet to occur, it's difficult to portray the shipments leaving China's shores as anything other than an act of subservience to the Japanese."
fengtian.44.a:0 "We will endure."
fengtian.45.t:0 "The Industrial Soy Proposal"
fengtian.45.d:0 "In light of the current anti-drought measures which have resulted in low provisions across Fengtian and considerable public upset, some government ministers have proposed cutting production of industrial soy, thus providing sufficient food but handicapping our civilian industry and some exports until the crisis is resolved."
fengtian.45.a:0 "Cut Industrial Soy."
fengtian.45.b:0 "We cannot afford this."
fengtian.46.t:0 "The Drought Ends"
fengtian.46.d:0 "After months of hardship, the drought in Korea and Japan has ended."
fengtian.46.a:0 "Finally!"
#Hokkaido Farming
fengtian.47.t:0 "A Proposal from Mantetsu"
fengtian.47.d:0 "A representative from Mantetsu's Research Wing has come forward with a proposal, the acceptance of which he assures the government is in its best interest, but which he insists must be kept completely secret. Apparently, following the Drought of 1939, Mantetsu brought together farming experts, senior officials from agricultural organisations, and academic scholars with relevant expertise in order to lead an initiative with the aim of improving agricultural efficiency and production in Fengtian. After months of testing, one of several research teams created a solution based upon farming methods used in Hokkaido, which might allow the average Chinese family to farm ten entire hectares of land without needing to hire seasonal workers, thus improving production and freeing up labour for factories in Anshan, Fushun, and Shenyang. The Mantetsu official indicates that these methods should be spread through the dissemination of informational leaflets and Chinese instructors, themselves trained by Japanese experts, and he seemed to stress the idea that this project should be disassociated in every possible way from the South Manchurian Railway.\n\nAfter some investigation, the Army's intelligence section has determined that the Kwantung Army refused to support Mantetsu's efforts for unclear reasons, suggesting that the two factions may be competing, or that this is simply a part of some elaborate Japanese ruse. The relatively liberal officials in Mantetsu's research wing and other bureaucratic roles have been known to clash with the conservative Kwantung Army."
fengtian.47.a:0 "Accept the proposal."
fengtian.47.b:0 "Refuse the proposal."

fengtian.48.t:0 "Hokkaido Farming Bears Fruit"
fengtian.48.d:0 "After much time and effort, the Hokkaido farming methods proposed by Mantetsu seem to be bearing fruit in some areas, increasing production, and freeing up additional land in the north."
fengtian.48.a:0 "Excellent."

fengtian.49.t:0 "Discovery"
fengtian.49.d:0 "Although neither made any public announcement, Mantetsu's research wing has communicated that the Kwantung Army discovered its farming collaboration with our government, a claim backed up by findings from our intelligence services. General Kekichi Ueda himself is said to have stormed into the office of the Mantetsu president, Yosuke Matsuoka, and delivered a thunderous verbal barrage regarding the necessity to keep Fengtian dependent upon Japanese aid. The Kwantung Army's ability to punish Mantetsu is ultimately limited, as the powerful company is practically autonomous, but there's little doubt that the Army will go out of its way to make things difficult for everyone involved. Unfortunately, this will certainly be the end of this specific collaboration project with Mantetsu."
fengtian.49.a:0 "Unfortunate."

fengtian.50.t:0 "Discovery"
fengtian.50.d:0 "Dr Y.C. James Yen, the leader of the Rural Reconstruction Movement, today denounced our collaboration with Mantetsu to bring Hokkaido farming styles to Fengtian, declaring that 'China must reform itself' and not submit to 'forced restructuring disguised as collaborative reform'. Our legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people will almost certainly be impacted severely by this turn of events. Some ministers suggest that we might defend our collaboration, painting it as an instance in which we are able to manipulate Mantetsu, instead of the other way around. Others suggest that this may simply dig our hole deeper."
fengtian.50.a:0 "Guilty as charged."
fengtian.50.b:0 "Our actions were legitimate!"

fengtian.51.t:0 "Popular Opinion Shifts in our Favour"
fengtian.51.d:0 "Against what seemed to be all odds, the government's defence of the Hokkaido farming project seems to have convinced not only Dr Yen, but also the vast majority of the population. The impact has been mitigated, and the programme can continue uninterrupted."
fengtian.51.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

fengtian.52.t:0 "The Public is Incensed!"
fengtian.52.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, both Dr Yen and the general public seem unconvinced by our defence of the Hokkaido Farming project. As a result, the programme will almost certainly grind to a halt, and the government's credibility has dwindled significantly."
fengtian.52.a:0 "Damn!"

#Focus Tree Specific Events

fengtian.53.t:0 "Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Army"
fengtian.53.d:0 "After decades of decline and destitution, the necessity of progress and development has never been more glaring, but still most reforms Zhang Zuolin has considered implementing are overshadowed by the possibility of discontent, disorder, and dissent. Still, stagnation bears as much risk as change, and the South will never be reclaimed without improvements.\n\nThus the task falls to the government to answer calls to 'Enrich the Country and Strengthen the Army', but limited resources force us to prioritise one or the other."
fengtian.53.a:0 "We must enrich the Country!"
fengtian.53.b:0 "We must strengthen the Army!"
fengtian.53.c:0 "Tell me more about the state of the Economy."
fengtian.53.e:0 "Tell me more about the state of the Army."

fengtian.54.t:0 "Enrich the Country"
fengtian.54.d:0 "While Manchuria's resources are rich and diverse, and Fengtian stands as the third greatest industrial centre in East Asia, its economy remains plagued by a number of structural problems, the symptoms of which cripple the state and slow progress toward Southern Reclamation. Fengtian's biggest investor is the state itself, feeding tax revenues back into key sectors such as steel, coal, and soybean production. Yet, the Japanese and Mantetsu trail the government only marginally in this regard, and invest far more widely, giving them an unquestioned grip upon both Fengtian's economy and society.\n\nWhile the extent of this grip grows by the day, reform could serve to increase the government's revenues through the suppression of otherwise endemic corruption, the creation of a healthier environment for private investment, and the unfortunate but necessary cooperation with Mantetsu in key areas like infrastructure and technology. So long as the government can maintain political autonomy, and at least a majority of control over the economy, it can pursue initiatives to contest Japanese influence, retain legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people, and eventually achieve its core goals.\n\nIt should be noted that while Japan has a vested interest in seeing us succeed relative to the Qing, they will only provide assistance with specific efforts aiming to move past our backward industry, even as they attempt to widen their already worrying influence over our economy."
fengtian.54.a:0 "Let us enrich the country!"
fengtian.54.b:0 "Perhaps the Army is more important?"

fengtian.55.t:0 "Strengthen the Army"
fengtian.55.d:0 "The Fengtian Army, officially the Army of the Republic, is an impressive sight by most Chinese standards, though pales in comparison to most foreign forces, and has only recently recovered much of its strength after its decimation in the last Zhifeng War. The majority of Fengtian's weapons and vehicles are outdated, even including its standard issue rifle provided by the Japanese, and organisation below the division level is a patchy affair due to limited communications equipment. The Army's greatest deficiency is in morale, partially as a consequence of foreign-trained and even outright Japanese officers widespread throughout the ranks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fengtian Flying Corps, officially The China Flying Corps, is the pride and joy of the Grand Marshal's oldest son, Zhang Xueliang, who used his passion for aviation to train its first pilots. The Flying Corps performed well during the war, and lost air superiority over the Zhili only upon the arrival of modern German-piloted planes. Since then, the Corps has grown slightly, though its planes remain over a decade behind the European standard.\n\nOverall, Fengtian's forces lag behind those of the Qing, and remain heavily dependent upon Japanese equipment and aid. This aid, and whatever Fengtian can do to become self-sufficient, will be crucial to narrowing that gap and eventually reclaiming the south."
fengtian.55.a:0 "Let us strengthen the Army!"
fengtian.55.b:0 "But what of the economy?"

fengtian.56.t:0 "An Empty-Handed Return"
fengtian.56.d:0 "Despite their best efforts, the scientists and engineers we dispatched to study Japanese manufacturing methods have returned empty-handed. Perhaps the sheer disparity in sophistication between their technology and our own was a hinderance, or maybe the Japanese went out of their way to be unhelpful. Whatever the case, the general population seems to have been impressed more by the apparent accomplishment of our 'top men' than their failure, as this has gone mysteriously unreported. As far as anyone knows, our scientists went overseas to receive very prestigious awards."
fengtian.56.a:0 "Top men."

fengtian.57.t:0 "Reforming Manchurian Finance"
fengtian.57.d:0 "At the start of the 20th century, Manchuria was a poorly managed frontier, fraught by lawlessness and banditry. With the rule of Zhang, however, came rapid reforms through his finance minister Wang Yongjiang. Wang backed his currency, originally no different from those printed by other warlords, with silver, generating confidence which led to some gains in value against the Japanese Yen. Extensive tax reform solved outstanding debts, and by the early 1920s the economy was bolstered by immigrants fleeing instability throughout the rest of China.\n\nOf course, this could not last, and Minister Wang resigned in 1928 and died the next year. With Fengtian's economy only beginning to recover from eight years of post-war decline, the time has come to implement new reforms, inspired by those of the old, and return the Northeast to its rightful place as one of China's most prosperous regions.\n\nA minister must be chosen to draw up the necessary plans and determine priorities for government efforts."
fengtian.57.a:0 "Appoint Pan Fu."
fengtian.57.b:0 "Appoint Li Shaogeng."
fengtian.57.c:0 "Appoint Sun Qichang."
fengtian.57.e:0 "Appoint Ruan Zhenduo."

fengtian.58.t:0 "Yamato Hotel Licenses"
fengtian.58.d:0 "Mantetsu's Yamato Hotel line has long been a staple of the South Manchuria Railway Zone; the concessions zone ceded first to Imperial Russia and then to Japan after 1906, and then expanded following the 21 demands of 1915 through a rather loose interpretation of its provisions to include all of southern Manchuria. All the same, while treaty rights permit Japanese to reside and engage in business and manufacture of any kind, construction still theoretically requires approval from the local governor and, if necessary, the Grand Marshal himself.\n\nMantetsu aims to build a series of new hotels, all of which will inevitably become hubs for further Japanese activity, and while construction could never be stopped without angering the Japanese government, limits might be imposed to forestall Japanese influence in certain areas. Unfortunately, as much as they may stand as physical edifices of Japan's strength, the hotels are frequented by the Japanese elite and many Mantetsu employees, making them crucial for the rapid development we desire."
fengtian.58.a:0 "Limit construction."
fengtian.58.b:0 "Let them build as they please."

fengtian.59.t:0 "The Northeast Industrial Development Commission"
fengtian.59.d:0 "At Japan's request, and with no particular reason to refuse, we have established a legal and fiscal framework enabling the creation of the Northeast Industrial Development Commission. Serving to oversee and direct the development of Fengtian's industry, mostly through the allocation of funds and leases, the commission now faces the question of its composition.\n\nThe Concordia Association has proposed the inclusion of a series of extremely talented individuals with experience working for the Nissan and Mitsubishi Zaibatsu in Japan, who stress the need for an export driven economy taking advantage of Fengtian's existing natural resources, while the Grand Marshal's generals insist upon the necessity of an 'Army First' approach to development, and are using their considerable influence to ensure the placement of military men on the commission. The Communications Clique recommends their own presence, and advocate a mixed developmental approach, referencing their long experience with business dealings across China, as well as more recently here in the Northeast.\n\nUnfortunately, a compromise involving all three parties is practically impossible, as a clear vision is necessary for the task, and intra-commission bickering would almost certainly render it functionally impotent. Additionally, although the commission's nature as an appointed body permits the presence of Japanese in its makeup, the public and much of the Assembly will likely react negatively to their presence. At the same time, the Japanese will not appreciate exclusion."

The sheer scale of Mantetsu Chosabū and its ambitions has lead to the opening of offices in Berlin, Vancouver, and New York to attract foreign talent, and wide recruitment from Japan's foremost universities. The result is a surprisingly liberal and open minded intellectual community, which sometimes goes insofar as to place scientific inquiry before nationalistic concerns.\n\nThis appears to be one of those instances, as our government has been approached by a Chosabū representative offering future assistance in one of several technological fields.

However, silver is an expensive commodity, and paying for enough to fill the reserve fully would undoubtedly cut funding from other areas.\n\nSome ministers have privately suggested only buying about half of the desired quantity, as many believed the reserve was less than full before the last Zhifeng War, and those rumours were never confirmed. Of course, it was later difficult to explain the significant economic recession that followed the government's inability to settle its war debts.\n\nStill, filling the reserve inadequately would certainly be a big risk, but perhaps a worthwhile one."

fengtian.71.d:0 "After the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank, major lenders to our own government, unexpectedly called for outstanding debts to be paid, our Central Bank suddenly found itself unable to provide sufficient silver for the transaction. News of the situation quickly leaked to the public provoking a run on the banks, and widespread financial panic. Rumour suggests that the crisis is not a product of gross mismanagement and incompetence on behalf of the government, which would surprise few in Fengtian, but rather a deliberate move to deceive the public. Mantetsu's offices in Shenyang and Harbin have already begun a full scale investigation, and unless action is taken they seem likely to discover a very incriminating paper trail.\n\nWhile there are several options available, it would be unfortunate if certain government files inexplicably went missing..."

We are in no position to refuse their calls for the arrests of several involved ministers, but conveniently the Grand Marshal and his closest advisers have been spared direct blame, and Mantetsu's Director Yosuke Matsuoka has suggested that in return for political favours, the entire matter could be shelved indefinitely."

fengtian.73.t:0 "Japan Agrees to the Bailout"
fengtian.73.d:0 "In a move that will surely save our economy, Japan has agreed to pay for sufficient silver to fill our reserve, and will not look further into the matter. Of course, this was likely inspired by little more than self interest, but some say that Japan may not be so bad after all..."

fengtian.74.t:0 "Japan Refuses the Bailout"
fengtian.74.d:0 "Despite our pleas, Japan has refused a bailout, leaving us in the same economic position we were before we made the request and with ample humiliation to boot. The only 'silver lining' is that many citizens, even including some employees of Mantetsu, have lost a great deal of faith in Japan's benevolent position toward China."

fengtian.75.d:0 "Fengtian's officer corps is an unusual mix of young Chinese educated at the Rikugun Shikan Gakkō in Japan, older Chinese who served in the Civil Wars, and Japanese officers part of the Military Mission to Fengtian, all united by common loyalties to individuals more than any special dedication to the state. Japanese officers in particular are known to prize any station in the Northeast, the devalued currency allowing them to live lives of relative luxury, and hire servants for most menial tasks, earning them the enmity of not only their fellows but also the local population.\n\nNow, with the founding of the Shenyang National Academy, these officers have taken the opportunity to mock the academy's current accommodations, which are decades old and in disrepair. While a newer modern building rises nearby, the pitiful state of the academy at present leaves the government open to criticism."
fengtian.75.a:0 "Unfortunate."

fengtian.76.d:0 "Japan has maintained a military mission in Fengtian ever since the founding of the Fengtian Government in 1926, who were preceded by over a decade of informal Japanese operations in support of Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Clique. The Mission has served to aid many aspects of the military's development, primarily through the supply of arms and equipment, but also training and planning assistance.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the shortage of officers in the aftermath of the civil wars provided Japan with the opportunity to attach Japanese officers to command positions in the field, and even lead our units independently. This has had a negative effect upon the morale of our men, making Japan's influence all too obvious, even as the Military Mission attempts, and often succeeds, in influencing our affairs of government. In order for our soldiers and the Chinese people to have any respect for our Government, the Japanese Military Mission must leave."

Doihara intends access the old market through the re-branding of these cigarettes as 'Golden Dragons', then sale via the Legation Cities to avoid Qing embargoes, and most crucially the insertion of trace amounts of opium to ensure quick addiction. All we would need to do is support poppy production in key areas of Liaobei and Xing'an, and in time the profits could begin to flow.\n\nDoihara is a thoroughly unsavoury character, and our involvement in such a project could undermine our political legitimacy, but the government desperately needs funds, and this might provide an edge against the Qing."

Conveying his apologies for delays in his programme over a very expensive meal in the elaborate dining room, Doihara seemed genuinely frustrated, but after returning, our agent has been careful to emphasise that progress is still on track and the money will be flowing soon.\n\nOther intelligence operatives in the Legation Cities, and other parts of China, tell a rather different story, and suggest that the operation is already profitable, with the vast majority of the money being used to fund Doihara's other subversive activities. The evidence seems to suggest that our representative in Shanghai has been bribed, but surely Doihara will eventually cough up what he's promised..."

fengtian.112.d:0 "The iron ore deposits at Anshan have been worked by a Japanese-owned subsidiary of Mantetsu since 1918, known as "Anshan Iron and Steel", serving as one of Japan's most valuable sources of steel outside the Home Islands. When the facilities were first constructed most of the ore required little digging, as the deposits lie close to the surface, but as of the current date more extensive excavation is required to continue operations. The company has begun this expansion work without acquiring a lease for the extra land from the local authorities, destroying several farm properties in the process, and despite promises neither compensation nor the lease have been forthcoming.\n\nProtests quickly broke out among local farmers over the issue, and quickly escalated into a riot that severely damaged expensive mining equipment, which our police refused to prevent, citing the technically illegal nature of the operations. On its own initiative, a nearby Japanese garrison from Anshan stepped in, and used lethal force to disperse the riot. This slaughter of our citizens has not gone unnoticed, and existing anti-Japanese sentiment has only been inflamed. The people will hold us accountable in our response, but the deposits and the company working them are essential to Japan's strategic goals, and our relationship with the Japanese permits little room to manoeuvre."

The Kwantung Garrison performed a series of motorised and armoured manoeuvres in full view of the capital, their message clear.

The natural chokepoint created by the Shanhai Pass has always made it hard for Zhili armies to get in, but equally difficult for our own to get out. Any effort to reclaim China has always depended upon a moment of southern weakness. Such a moment now seems set to arrive, as simmering anti-German sentiment has erupted into violence in the League of Eight Provinces, and the governor of Anhui has broken away from Nanjing - hoping to leverage the League and the Central Government against one another for his own gain.\n\nUnfortunately we are not yet ready to begin our long-awaited campaign, there are outstanding issues in the Northeast to be settled and it is still not clear exactly what will become of the situation in the League. We must watch and wait for the right opportunity."

The conversation, in which the Grand Marshal described "enemies to the North, South, East, and West", puts Fengtian's relations with Japan in unconventionally blunt terms damaging to our propaganda and Japan's interests.\n\nThe broadcast was doubly damaging thanks to its capture of Zhang discussing the realities of Qing's relative industrial and military strength, and the degree to which we must rely on the Japanese for crucial technology, something which we have been careful to conceal from the public."

fengtian.151.t:0 "The Bastion in the North"
fengtian.151.d:0 "As the year 1936 dawns, Fengtian stands in the Northeast as the final bastion of China's Republican dream. As with many things in China however, the abstractions of this dream hide complex and often inconvenient truths. The Fengtian Government of the Republic of China, contesting Qing's claims to legitimacy, maintains democracy only as a thin veneer, covering what has always been, and perhaps always will be, an authoritarian state.\n\nThe Assembly in Shenyang is widely regarded to be corrupt, power divided between autocratic generals, unscrupulous railway barons, and Pan-Asianist ideologues with questionable motivations. Amid it all stands Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin, his ambitions great, but limited by the stark realities of Qing strength and Japanese power; for now forced to walk a political tightrope between the two, and above the machinations of his own divided government. The status quo cannot last forever, and if the right moment to strike south is not chosen soon, it may never come at all.\n\nThe staggering cost of the wars with the south and the severance of economic ties left Fengtian reeling, and while past years have been spent rebuilding, there is much left to do. Likewise the army has suffered from neglect, and must be reorganised. The Japanese, their influence growing by the day, present both a dire threat and an opportunity. The waters ahead are treacherous, and it will take a truly great helmsman to steer the ship of state not only to survival, but also toward the reclamation of all China.\n\nBriefings are available on Fengtian's special mechanics, its relationship with the Japanese, and internal politics."

fengtian.152.d:0 "The Fengtian Government is unstable, pressured from without and within, ultimately a fusion of elements that would be contradictory were it not for their shared goals. The parties, more accurately termed factions, exercise their grip through dominance of the country's institutions instead of mass appeal. As such, the 'popularity' of parties should be taken to represent their degree of control over the country's government and other structures of power, control being determined not by the popular policies of ministers, but by choices, focuses, and events that increase or diminish their power.\n\nConsequently, your aim should be to balance the various factions, each of which has the potential to abuse their power if given too much of it, though each will do so differently. As they grow in strength, the factions will nominate ministers, each of whom will pursue his own agenda, potentially in line with his faction, or his country, but which could also have negative consequences in the short or long term.\n\nAnother crucial point is the role of the Concordia Association, also explained in the politics briefing, the strength of which can be taken as a loose indicator of Japanese influence over the country. As their influence grows, it will lead to increasing bonuses to production, but at the cost of political power and autonomy. The rise of this influence is inevitable over time, and should be viewed with caution."

While the Grand Marshal and others utilise a wide variety of means to slow and inconvenience the Japanese, their presence is necessary and the growth of their influence inevitable. The primary institution responsible for this growth is the South Manchuria Railway Company, more commonly termed 'Mantetsu', the profits from which in recent years have accounted for nearly a quarter of Japan's entire national budget.\n\nAt the same time, the Japanese need Fengtian and what it represents. Its cooperation and the prospect of a victory in the South offer to save Japan a great deal of time and money. The result is a tenuous balance, the Japanese ever looking for more profit and power, but well aware that pushing too hard will place Zhang Zuolin in a politically untenable position, and thus bring their careful efforts to naught.\n\nSo far Zhang has pursued a patchwork policy; promotion of Pan-Asian brotherhood with Japan, only to intermittently replace this with repudiations of Japanese initiatives that push too far, and consistent private efforts to lessen Japanese influence. How to proceed will be your choice, but caution is advised."

The Recovery League\n\nA loose association of fallen generals, governors, bureaucrats, and politicians without any strong ideological affiliation, most of whom find themselves in Fengtian because there are few other places where they might hold any semblance of power. Easily bribed and tempted, they often serve to promote the interests of whoever is willing to pay, and consequently the 'league' is highly splintered despite controlling a large portion of the Assembly, lacking the political will to act decisively.\n\n2. The Zhang Clique\n\nA collection of loyalists and generals, the Zhang Clique holds no specific ideology beyond promoting the furtherance of the Grand Marshal's political powers. While making pretences to democracy, Zhang's supporters are not committed to republican ideals, and promote them only for their utility.\n\n3. The Communications Clique\n\nThe sole politically coherent faction to emerge from the former Beiyang Government, the Communications Clique are a collection of railroad and telegraph barons, primarily self-interested, but locked in confrontation with Mantetsu and the Concordia Association over the country's infrastructure.\n\n4. The Concordia Association\n\nA grouping of politicians and lobbyists with all the trappings of a party, the Concordia Association represents the interests of Mantetsu, and sometimes other Japanese Zaibatsu, in the Assembly. Their actual ideological positions vary, some using the Japanese to counter Zhang's power for their own gain, with others subscribing to Pan-Asian principles."

However, few would have predicted a move such as this; a daring series of raids into Mongolian territory, striking the trading centre of Duolun, and eliciting a fierce response from the local Xilingol League. Skirmishes have erupted all along the Jehol-Chahar border, and neither side seems willing to give ground.\n\nStrangely word has reached the government's ears only now, after nearly a day of fighting, and it seems Tang may have abused his office in order to further escalate the conflict.

fengtian.193.d.jinhan:0 "Originally financed by Belgian capital, the Jinghan Railway runs north-to-south from Beijing in Zhili to Hankou in Hubei. For decades it has served as one of China's primary transit arteries, ferrying goods across the length of the North China Plain, and connecting its width by way of Zhengzhou.\n\nIn the years since its construction the railway has fallen on hard times, and so while the Belgians are long gone it will take a great deal of investment to restore its infrastructure and integrate it with our new national railway services. Of course, we could always ask Mantetsu to do it free of charge."
fengtian.193.d.jinpu:0 "Financed by British and German capital nearly fifteen years before the Weltkrieg, the Jinpu Railway runs north-to-south from Tianjin to Pukou, a district of Nanjing. Like the Jinghan Railway, it has long served as one of China's most important logistical arteries, connecting north with south, and east with west by way of Xuzhou.\n\nIn the years since the last Zhifeng War the sections of the railway in Shandong and Jiangsu gradually fell under the sway of the German AOG, which updated and expanded its infrastructure. However, as the company's employees have now been driven away or shot as Hanjian they will need to be replaced. Unfortunately the process of finding and paying these individuals, not to mention re-integrating the railway itself, could prove a costly enterprise. Of course, we could always ask Mantetsu to do it free of charge."
fengtian.193.d.yuehan:0 "The Yuehan Railway, connecting Hankou and Guangdong, was born amid a conflict between Belgian and American investors, and as such took abnormally long to complete once both parties pulled out of the project. The railway was ultimately completed under the supervision of the German AOG in the early 1930s, and remained under their control until the collapse of Sun Chuanfang's League.\n\nWith the Germans gone it will need entirely new management and integration into the new national railway system. This will be an expensive task, though we could always ask Mantetsu to do it for us."

The reasoning behind this is that the advantage that Anqing gives us is so great that we must not waste it by going to war while they are weak. The risk is that the Beijing government is able to mount a proper defense before that time. The other option is to not wait for Anqing to recover, but attack as soon as we are able to. The risk is that the Anqing government might collapse, but Qing is still reeling from the effects of the League War and are also weak. We have been mostly insulated from the conflict.

One possibility is to simply split the western Xuhai region, which would go to Zhang, from the eastern Huaiyang region, with the latter including Nantong and going to Chen. It is unlikely Chen will see this as sufficient as the province was ruled from Xuzhou, which is also where the province's most important railroads meet. Another possibility is to separate economic from political control. In this scenario, one would officially run Jiangsu's government, which would of course have to be led by at least a somewhat independent governor. Then the other would be allowed to nominate a lieutenant governor, who would have control over all the province's resources and be allowed to levy taxes and conduct recruitment among other things."

Times are still hard for the average peasant, and brigands still roam the hills, but by and large our own troops have burned themselves out and settled down. Henan in particular has seen its fair share of famine, violence, and other tragedy, in which this may be little more than a historical footnote, but for the lives it touched, and certainly the lives it claimed, the events of [GetYear] will never be forgotten."
fengtian.278.d_good:0 "After some inevitable violence, and a wave of all too familiar banditry, Henan has settled back into relative normality. The province is no stranger to tragedy, and so the relatively decent conduct of our troops throughout has turned some heads. Local business owners, landlords, and government officials appreciate our soldiers' restraint, and it's their support that will be essential to governing the province in the future."

##Wuhan Events
fengtian.279.t: "Destruction in Wuhan"
fengtian.279.d_bad:0 "China's republican dream was born in Wuhan, and today we are its torchbearers. Sadly revolutionary ideals were far from the minds of our soldiers who, after encountering unexpected resistance in Wuchang, proceeded to run wild through the city, looting indiscriminately. By the time order was restored, the docks, wharfs, and all manner of river-side businesses were reduced to ashes, along with sizable residential areas. What might have otherwise served as political victory became a political defeat, and a mark of shame.\n\nOn a more positive note, our troops were able to recover a stockpile of equipment from the now abandoned Hanyang Arsenal, though it is suspected that a certain number of weapons were siphoned away and onto the black market."
fengtian.279.d_good:0 "China's republican dream was born in Wuhan, and today we are its torchbearers. Fortunately this seems to have been on the minds of our soldiers when entering the city, which survived the fighting relatively unharmed, especially as looting was limited. After fighting their way across the North China Plain, it seems our troops have begun to acknowledge the benefits of a grateful populace. Our army, consisting as it does of so many former bandits and vagabonds, may never change completely, but today's relative restraint is a step forward.\n\nTo add to the good news, our troops have recovered a stockpile of equipment from the now abandoned Hanyang Arsenal."
fengtian.279.a:0 "Shameful"
fengtian.279.b:0 "What a relief!"

fengtian.280.t:0 "Disaster at the Daye Mines"
fengtian.280.d:0 "Ore has been mined at Daye for over two thousand years, and today iron from its depths feeds the fires of modern industry in Wuhan, Hubei, and the Lower Yangtze. This did nothing to stop our soldiers, who upon hearing rumors that gold was to be found there, plundered the mine and, in their disappointment at finding nothing of the sort, collapsed its entrance - trapping over one hundred miners inside. A rescue effort has been proposed, but such expense is widely considered wasted on common laborers. Those responsible for the disaster, meanwhile, have deserted and are nowhere to be found."
fengtian.280.a:0 "Begin rescue operations."
fengtian.280.b:0 "Life is cheap."

fengtian.281.t_bad:0 "Tragedy in the Mines"
fengtian.281.t_good:0 "Miners Rescued in Daye"
fengtian.281.d_bad:0 "By the time our men broke through to the trapped miners in Daye, all had perished. While this is certainly not the outcome we were hoping for, the fact that our men tried at all has been received well by the local community, and more importantly by national newspapers."
fengtian.281.d_good:0 "Thanks to an old O&K steam shovel brought over from a neighboring mine, our soldiers were able to break through in time to rescue dozens of miners. Despite their initial reservations, the men seem to feel that the heartfelt gratitude of the laborers and their families made it well worth the effort, and praise by national newspapers has offset most political fallout from the disaster itself.\n\nTo add to the positive turn of events, an assortment of weapons crates were brought up by the grateful miners, which had apparently been stashed there during the enemy's retreat not so long ago."
fengtian.281.a:0 "What a waste."
fengtian.281.b:0 "Wansui!"

fengtian.282.t:0 "Remember the Experience in Ju"
fengtian.282.d:0 "The years since the formation of our Government have laid for us a solid foundation for national regeneration. We fear no problems, nor are we concerned over impending dangers. We merely lament the fate of the South, the freedom of which was originally brought about by the hard efforts and sacrifices of reformist patriots, and which has since been erased by the old and outmoded forms of government. Today, her people are powerless, and her rulers without integrity, thus allowing the slow degradation of the national condition, and the return to a state of total subservience to Western nations. These old ways are sapping China's national strength, shaking her national foundations, and subjugating her people.\n\nIt is thus that we find ourselves in the North, as the final bastion of all that our predecessors struggled to build, and the bearers of the future of a new China. The regressive Qing government likes to say that, by fortifying the Northeast, we are 'digging a hole to die in'. To this I say 'Forget not what happened in Ju'. It was to Ju that the State of Qi retreated, and from there that it reconquered all that it had lost. When the time is right, the Northeast will be our Ju, and the whole of China will be our Qi. Our victory is inevitable, long live the Republic!"
fengtian.282.a:0 "Wansui!"

fengtian.283.d:0 "An old proverb says: 'Virtue never lacks company; it will ever find support.' The forces of justice will rise, and men of goodwill ultimately co-operate in the interests of rectitude. There is little question that the regressive and illegitimate Qing government stands in the way of progress, oppressing and subjugating the Chinese people, and I have received every assurance that our allies will stand with us to end this injustice. On our part, we should hold fast, fix our eyes steadfastly on our goal, and be firm in our determination. The entire Northeast should carry on with oneness of heart. The final victory will be ours. I urge my ministers, our army, and our people to redouble their efforts in order to attain success.\n\nIt is in this spirit, that I proclaim the beginning of the Year of Righteous Effort, a full three hundred and sixty five days of strenuous national effort, from which we shall emerge as a force unstoppable in the pursuit of our goal. And, when this year is done, the Five Colour Flag will fly high again in Beijing, and the Qing government will be nothing but ash in the winds of history. Ten thousand years to the Republic! Zhonghua Mingguo Wansui!"

fengtian.284.d:0 "The Central Government under [FNG.GetLeader] has demanded that we formally relinquish control of our armies and territory. While [ROOT.GetLeader] and his subordinates will be permitted to retain their current titles and positions, there is no way to know what the future might bring. On the one hand surrendering most of our autonomy would be the patriotic thing to do, and perhaps the safest in the short term. On the other hand, freedom is sweet."

fengtian.285.t:0 "Fengtian's Ultimatum"
fengtian.285.d:0 "A representative of the Fengtian Government has delivered an ultimatum to our consulate in [FNG.GetCapital], demanding that we remove our military presence from China over the next three months, and return our various territorial concessions at once. According to the military this flagrant disprespect, made all the more despicable in light of our long-standing cooperation with [FNG.GetLeader], cannot go unanswered. However some quieter voices from the Foreign Ministry suggest that this might be the only way to secure a lasting alliance with China."

fengtian.286.a:0 "A more equal relationship, at last."

fengtian.287.t:0 "Zuolin Plans To Step Back"
fengtian.287.d:0 "Zhang Zuolin has announced his plans to step back from his position as President of the Republic, making way for his son Xueliang - a promising young man with a Western education, albeit also a troubling if not uncommon relationship with opium. Zuolin will stay on as Grand Marshal, cementing his control over the military, and many are already seeing this move as a way for Zhang to draw attention away from his past banditry and military service, traits considered unbecoming of a national political leader, while retaining a de-facto monopoly on power."
fengtian.287.a:0 "Long live the Grand Marshal."

fengtian.288.t:0 "The Shikan Clique Protests"
fengtian.288.d:0 "The Shikan Clique, a group of officers within the Fengtian Army educated at Japanese academies, has quietly but forcefully protested Zhang Zuolin's decision to hand the presidency to his son. Citing Zhang Xueliang's addiction to opium, and his well-known years of carousing in Shanghai's casinos and pleasure palaces, Yang Yuting, the de-facto face of the Shikan group, called the move 'dangerous and divisive'. This is likely an attempt by Yang to jockey for additional power within the Fengtian Clique as a whole, but more concerningly he may also be speaking for the Kwantung Army, which is known to distrust Xueliang due to his anti-Japanese leanings."
fengtian.288.a:0 "Ineffectual ditherings."

fengtian.289.t:0 "A Sinister Plot"
fengtian.289.d:0 "An unusual notice has made it's way to the government's attention, passed along by Kenji Doihara, whose clandestine operations are well known within our intelligence circles. Apparently Yang Yuting, an influential and notably pro-Japanese general within the Fengtian Army, is plotting the overthrow and assassination of Zhang Zuolin. The move seems to have been spurred by Zhang's decision to grant his son the presidency, which may simply reflect factional squabbling, but the appointment has already been concerning for many in the War Ministry. Zhang Xueliang's anti-Japanese sentiments are well known, and should he seize any real power there could be consequences for our relationship with the Fengtian Government, and our long-laid plans in China as a whole.\n\n"We could choose to support Yang Yuting's power grab, and he is a well known friend to Japan. On the other hand some in the Foreign Ministry are advising caution, and alleging that this entire operation is a product of meddling by our own units based in Manchuria. The Kwantung Army has long been known to have far more assertive foreign policy inclinations than the government in Tokyo."
fengtian.289.a:0 "Give them covert assistance."
fengtian.289.b:0 "This is too dangerous."

fengtian.290.t:0 "Ambush in Shenyang!"
fengtian.290.d:0 "In the middle of a busy Shenyang street, Zhang Zuolin's custom-built armor-plated car suddenly came under fire as a small bomb exploded under its wheels. The vehicle was thrown violently upward, and then careened into a nearby tailor's shop. A shootout immediately began as ambushers on both sides of the street began to open fire on the car's surviving occupants, and by the time reinforcements arrived almost fifteen minutes later its owner had suffered various burns and injuries by both shrapnel and bullets. Zhang Zuolin's life now hangs in the balance."
fengtian.290.a:0 "He cannot be saved."
fengtian.290.b:0 "He must live!"

fengtian.291.t:0 "The Zhaode Dajie Incident"
fengtian.291.d:0 "Zhang Zuolin was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by assassins on Shenyang's Zhaode main street only a matter of hours ago. It was his leadership that served to underpin the entirety of the Fengtian Clique and its government, and now the power vacuum left in his wake threatens to swallow the entirety of the Northeast. Soon every soldier and officer, every contact and associate of the Old Marshal, must question his loyalties and pick a side - if there are even to be sides at all. As of now two loose factions seem set to emerge: a collection of loyalists and nationalists beneath Zhang Xueliang's banner, facing a number of Japanese-educated officers and opportunists aligned with Yang Yuting, who almost certainly had some role to play in Zuolin's assassination. Whoever strikes a decisive blow first will be entitled to Zhang Zuolin's legacy."
fengtian.291.a:0 "Xueliang rallies his father's loyalists."

fengtian.292.d:0 "After convincing the remnants of the cabinet and most of the general staff to take his side, either through persuasion or more coercive means, Zhang Xueliang has emerged as the sole victor following his father's untimely demise. Yang Yuting, meanwhile, has been politically defeated, and soon retreated to a safe-house outside Shenyang to recoup his losses and take stock of the situation.\n\nYang still holds influence with a number of the Fengtian Army's most talented commanders, and so he may be betting on Zhang Xueliang's willingness to compromise and worry that, without them, he may fall behind his enemies elsewhere in China, or even in Japan."
fengtian.292.a:0 "The Young Marshal will have his chance."

fengtian.293.t:0 "A Mystery"
fengtian.293.d.zuolin:0 "As the fires on Zhaode Main Street are put out and the bodies recovered from the rubble, the exact identity and motivation of the attackers remains a mystery. With no uniforms to identify them, and no central database for photographic identification, these men could be from anywhere, and acting under anyone's command. Some may have escaped amid the chaos, and might be tracked down, but such efforts will take weeks or months if they yield anything at all.\n\nWe must count ourselves fortunate that Zhang Zuolin survived the attack, against all odds." #Zuolin's POV

An auspicious day has been selected for the funeral, and already the streets are lined with citizens paying their respects, or simply caught up in the moment. Before them passes an impressive funeral cortege, replete with all the Old Marshal's earthly possessions rendered in paper, so that they may be burned and carried with him up to heaven. Eventually the pallbearers will reach a stone mausoleum outside Shenyang, where the story of this once-bandit who came to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Presidents and Emperors will finally come to an end. "
fengtian.294.a:0 "Farewell, Old Marshal."

fengtian.295.t:0 "The Purge of the Shikan Clique"
fengtian.295.d:0 "The invitation to play cards came as something of a surprise to Yang Yuting, who had expected a more formal summons. Nontheless, he interpreted the letter as a good sign - perhaps Zhang Xueliang had seen the light and decided to negotiate. He might be taking a risk by walking into the Young Marshal's arms, but it was one he had to take.\n\nHis car arrived at Zhang's mansion in the early evening, and upon entering main hall he received a bullet to the back of the head. There would be no negotiating after all.\n\nThe Shikan Clique has subsequently been dismantled, taken apart man by man in a relentless but pragmatic campaign of revenge. Some generals will be allowed to serve on under close watch, but even slight suspicion of involvement in the Zhaode Incident was a death sentence. The Fengtian Army's cohesion has taken a great blow today, but there could be no other answer."

fengtian.297.d.zuolin:0 "Though still recovering from his serious wounds, Zhang Zuolin has loudly denounced our involvement in the botched attempt against his life. Though this is an embarassing moment for us, as few expected him to survive or much less discover our involvement, it is also one of crisis.

There is no easy way out of this mess." #Zuolin alive
fengtian.297.d.xueliang:0 "Much to our surprise Zhang Xueliang, believed by most to be an opium-riddled bohemian, has not only prevailed against Yang Yuting but also discovered our involvement in his father's assassination. The fury on his face is not difficult to read, even from the poor photographs obtained by our intelligence services, and today the Young Marshal announced our actions to the world. Though this is an embarassing moment for us, we cannot take this direct challenge lying down. Yet aggressive action would destroy our only partnership on the Chinese mainland, and render the whole of the country hostile once again. There is no easy way out of this mess." #Xueliang took over

fengtian.298.t:0 "The Zhaode Dajie Incident"
fengtian.298.d:0 "It seems that the attack on Zhaode Main Street was carried out at the behest of none other than Yang Yuting, leader of the Shikan Clique. After his agents' simultaneous plans were foiled across the country, Yang retreated to a safehouse outside Shenyang. From there he may have intended to flee or fight back, but ultimately it didn't matter. Once it became known that Yang had taken up residence, the structure was levelled by heavy artillery at Zhang's own direction. A body, which may or may not have been Yang's, was pulled from the wreckage, its head decapitated and placed on a pike.\n\nFrom there Shikan Clique was subsequently dismantled, taken apart man by man in a relentless but pragmatic campaign of revenge. Some generals were allowed to serve on under close watch, but even slight suspicion of involvement in the Zhaode Incident was a death sentence. The Fengtian Army's cohesion has taken a great blow as a consequence, but to such treachery there could be no other answer."

fengtian.299.t:0 "Yuting Takes Over"
fengtian.299.d:0 "Travelers attempting to enter Shenyang this evening were shocked to witness troops of the Kwantung Army rush out of the darkness and onto the roads, hurriedly deploying searchlights, sandbags, and machine guns along all the city's main thoroughfares. Soon their opposition arrived, batallions of Fengtian Army troops from Fushin, Liaoyang, and Xinmin, called there by Zhang Xueliang's plea for reinforcements. As these troops attempted to negotiate their way into the city, Yang Yuting's forces seized key positions across Shenyang in a matter of hours. By dawn, and with the Japanese troops refusing to budge, the Young Marshal's resistance had been crushed, and Japan announced its intent to 'safeguard regional security' by deploying additional troops in the area. Unable to break the deadlock and now threatened by crack Japanese divisions, loyalist units around the city peeled away and broke apart - mirroring others across the country as Japanese troops soon swept across the region.\n\nThe Fengtian Government is, for all intents and purposes, dead. With Yang Yuting at the helm it has become just another Japanese puppet, meaning that its allies have broken away and its political support has collapsed. The way forward is unclear."
fengtian.299.a:0 "A new era."

fengtian.300.t:0 "A Puppet in Manchuria"
fengtian.300.d:0 "All our best efforts in Manchuria have come to fruition. With Zhang Zuolin dead and Zhang Xueliang out of the picture, Yang Yuting should prove a pliable puppet suited to our purposes. While we may no longer have an easy route to control of China as a whole, we have safeguarded our own security. Without Manchurian resources our economy would founder, and from there an enemy could easily take Korea, then plunge a dagger into the heart of Japan. This is how history is made."

As a result, he could be a vital asset in the propaganda war against Qing, or a substantial inconvenience in our complicated relationship with Japan.\n\nWu's extant ties to the Foreign Ministry and its importance to the Recovery League means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the final decision rests with the Grand Marshal."

However, this same background has left him illiterate, particularly hostile to the Japanese, and without any formal military training whatsoever.\n\nAlready, members of the other factions have voiced their complaints about the placement of a 'bandit lord' on the cabinet, even including some other members of the Zhang Clique, and it seems clear that the appointment was secured by Ma's patron Wu Junsheng.\n\nThe decision is left with the Grand Marshal."

As a result, his appointment seems likely to be a product of Clique internal politics, or merely well placed bribes funded by his considerable wealth.\n\nShort of any ill-advised attempts to open conflict over Chahar, or any administrative embarrassments, Tang stands to be a low-key minister unlikely to stir political competition.

fngshen.12.t:0 "Zongchang's Drunken Rants"
fngshen.12.d:0 "After drinking Sake by what we can only assume to be the barrel-load, [SQI.GetLeader] has created a scene today as he slurred and yelled his way through a drunken tirade. What little could be understood of his ravings were nothing short of a love letter to Japan with only his love for Japanese booze and women being comprehended by the hostage audience, if only through repetition. Most of Zhang's incomprehensible ravings were, for better or for worse, impossible to understand, which may have been a blessing in disguise.\n\nAfter creating a spectacular scene, he got up on his chair and put one boot down on the table. Before he could be made to sit down again, he declared a toast to Japan, with the rest of his speech sounded more like a man struggling to hold back vomit than actual words. To say that this has created a negative atmosphere among the conference attendants would be the understatement of the decade."
fngshen.12.a:0 "Stop embarassing us!"

fngshen.13.t:0 "Yang Yuting Urges Caution"
fngshen.13.d:0 "With Anti-Concessionist sentiments rising, Yang Yuting has come forward to urge Zuolin to be cautious with regards to the stance on the Concessions. Because of Japan's strong interests in them, particularly through its China Agency in the Legation Cities, they stand to lose greatly if we went ahead and declared ourselves to be against the Concessions. Because of our healthy and mutually beneficial cooperation, alienating them would be seen by Tokyo as not merely an insult, but naked aggression against them.\n\nWhile hardly unexpected, Yuting's actions prove that Japan is worried about our eventual decision. If nothing else, it's a reminder that they will not sit idly by if we join the anti-Concessionist movement."
fngshen.13.a:0 "A fair warning."

fngshen.14.t:0 "The Point of Decision"
fngshen.14.d:0 "Facing insurmountable pressure from his potential partners, Zuolin must decide whether he agrees to the anti-Concessionist stance that has overtaken the conference or tries to argue against them. Siding against the anti-Concessionists would be devastating for any chance of forming a strong alliance. Doing so, however, would be tantamount to breaking off from Tokyo."
fngshen.14.a:0 "Very well, we accept."
fngshen.14.b:0 "We cannot turn our back on Japan."

FNG_federalist_allies:0 "§GThe Federalists will join our efforts against [QIE.GetNameDef]!§!"

FNG_anqing_angered:0 "§R[ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] will be greatly angered by this decision!§!"

fngshen.15.t:0 "The Federalist-[FNG.GetCliqueShortName] Alliance"
fngshen.15.d:0 "It wasn't easy to overcome the numerous differences between us. In the end though, pragmatism won out and enough common ground was found to make this unlikely friendship a reality. [FNG.GetCliqueShortName] and the Federalists of [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetCliqueShortName] are now on the same side following a long series of secretive negotiations. Let us hope that this alliance stands the test of time."
fngshen.15.a:0 "Excellent."

fngshen.16.t:0 "[ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] Reaffirms Its Support"
fngshen.16.d:0 "We've received official word from [ANQ.GetLeader] that we can rely on [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName]'s support in the future. Pleased with our pledges made throughout the conference, our friendship still stands. We can count on their support in the conflicts with Beijing that lie ahead."
fngshen.16.a:0 "Thank you!"

fngshen.17.t:0 "End of the Conference"
fngshen.17.d:0 "Although there was no shortage of hurdles to overcome along the way, diplomacy has won the day. The Shenyang Conference has ended in a success for [Root.GetCliqueShortName], cementing their position in the region at the expense of the Beijing government. As the delegates left after a cordial closing ceremony after which the delegates left the city. Zhang Zuolin is now several steps closer to turning his ambitions into reality."
fngshen.17.a:0 "Next stop: Beijing!"

fngshen.18.t:0 "The Federalists Storm Off"
fngshen.18.d:0 "Finding a compromise on the Concessions proved to be an insurmountable task. It was simply politically impossible for the Federalists to make a complete U-turn on the matter, while Zhang's refusal to budge is being publicly mocked as a simple refusal to bite the hand that feeds it. After publicly denouncing the conference as a sham, the Federalist delegation led by [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetLeader] left the conference. Any chance for an alliance between them and [Root.GetCliqueShortName] is now likely an outright impossibility."
fngshen.18.a:0 "This will be trouble."

fngshen.19.t:0 "Zuolin Refuses Our Demands"
fngshen.19.d:0 "Evidently, Zuolin simply could not bite the hand that fed him. By declaring his opposition to the anti-Concessionists, he's showed his colors for all of China to see. There's absolutely no way we can side with [From.GetCliqueShortName] under these circumstances. While we'd hoped that he'd see reason, we can't say we're surprised either. Our delegation left the conference earlier today, leaving Zuolin with his Japanese cronies."
fngshen.19.a:0 "What to expect from a Japanese puppet?"

fngshen.20.t:0 "[From.GetCliqueShortName] Refuses to Denounce the Concessions"
fngshen.20.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, our delegates could not convince Zuolin to stand against the concessions. This declaration of unconditional support for Tokyo and the other colonial bloodsuckers is nothing less than a grave insult to Tiaoyuan and a betrayal of his trust. Rest assured, we'll not let this go lightly."
fngshen.20.a:0 "Denounce him!"

fngshen.21.t:0 "Tiaoyuan Breaks Off the Alliance"
fngshen.21.d:0 "The [FNG.GetCliqueShortName] stance on the Concessionist question proved to be a bridge that couldn't be crossed. Unable to break against everything he's stood for, Chen Tiaoyuan sharply denounced Zhang Zuolin in the harshest possible terms for his cowardice and subservience to Tokyo. He angrily declared the alliance between [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] and [FNG.GetCliqueShortName] to be dead and buried on the spot and that there was no way to reverse this unless Zhang decided to side with his countrymen over the Japanese. The [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] delegation quickly left the conference afterwards. Needless to say, this has dealt a black eye to Zuolin's diplomatic efforts."
fngshen.21.a:0 "Drat."

fngconf.1.t:0 "A National Reunification Conference"
fngconf.1.d:0 "Having broken through the Shanhai Pass, our army sent shockwaves across the nation when they seized the city of Beijing, and once again the Five Color Flag flies above the city! With this victory we have taken the first major step toward national reunification, and resumed our role as an active contender for national leadership.\n\nIntending to seize the moment, Marshal Zhang has ordered his staff to begin assembling a plan for the peaceful unification of China. If put into motion - and more importantly, agreed upon - it would see the remaining provinces in China united without any further bloodshed, raising the legitimacy of our government immeasurably. The plan is not without its opponents, of course, as some politicians doubt an undertaking of this scale can be accomplished, while some members of the military believe that diplomacy will only prevent the formation of a strong central authority and leave the country again united in name only.\n\nWe must carefully consider this decision, as the stroke of a pen here could have a far bigger impact than any order the Old Marshal has given in his long and storied career."
fngconf.1.a:0 "Send the invites!"
fngconf.1.b:0 "Only the sword can unite China!"

fngconf.2.t:0 "Attend the National Reunification Conference?"
fngconf.2.d:0 "Having seized Beijing and raised the Five Color Flag above its walls, the Fengtian Government has taken its first major step toward its planned 'reclamation' of China, and resumed its role as an active contender for national leadership. Its leader, Marshal Zhang Zuolin, has called for a national conference to discuss what he calls 'the peaceful unification of China'. Supporters of the notion emphasize unity in the face of Western imperialism, whereas the detractors cite everything from Zuolin's dependence on Japanese support to the very structure of the Fengtian Government.\n\nPast disagreements and disputes aside, the fact that the winds are blowing in Zhang Zuolin's direction means that we wouldn't lose face by attending, but simply attending might grant him legitimacy."
fngconf.2.a:0 "Yes, we will attend."
fngconf.2.b:0 "This is a waste of time."

fngconf.3.t:0 "Denounced by [QIE.GetNameDef]"
fngconf.3.d.zhili:0 "To the surprise of no one, the the warlords who foolishly bet on the Zhili are denouncing our attempts to unite China under our banner, citing every ridiculous reason between heaven and earth to justify their allegations against us. If they aren't calling us warmongering criminals, they're accusing us of merely being Japanese cronies. Evidently, they're far more interested in bickering over what they lost when the Zhili fell from prominence rather than uniting for the good of China."
fngconf.3.d.manchu:0 "To the surprise of no one, the the warlords who foolishly bet on the Manchu are denouncing our attempts to unite China under our banner, citing every ridiculous reason between heaven and earth to justify their allegations against us. If they aren't calling us warmongering criminals, they're accusing us of merely being Japanese cronies. Evidently, they're far more interested in bickering over what they lost when the Manchu fell from prominence rather than uniting for the good of China."
fngconf.3.a:0 "We expected no different."

fngconf.4.t:0 "The Enemy to the South"
fngconf.4.d:0 "In response to our recently announced plan to hold a conference for the unification of China, a Kuomintang representative has publicly denounced us and declared that the party will boycott our initiative. Denouncing us as warlords, bandits, and Japanese running dogs, they're already calling the conference illegitimate and intend to ignore whatever negotiated document it might produce. It should surprise no one that the radicals whose only goal is to uproot all of China's traditions and culture have no interest in seeing reason."
fngconf.4.a:0 "We expected no different."

fngconf.5.t.JAP:0 "The Conference in Beijing"
fngconf.5.d.JAP:0 "We have received word that our friends in Shenyang are arranging a conference aiming to unite China under the Fengtian Government. With the winds clearly blowing in his direction, Zhang Zuolin believes that this is the best opportunity to pull the country together, as no one else can legitimately claim to be able to fill the power vacuum left in the wake of former Beijing government's collapse.\n\nSubsequently, we need to decide what our role in the conference, if any, should be. While we naturally cannot be represented by regular delegates, many in the Foreign Ministry have suggested that we should demand observer status. While we would not have any voting rights, some are arguing that our presence would support claims that Zhang Zuolin is operating at our behest, and thus undermine both our positions in China. The rest, however, seem to agree that our reasons to attend are legitimate, and that we shouldn't be held captive by the irrational fears of Chinese nationalists. After all, should this conference begin to develop in a direction contrary to Japanese interests, it would be best to know first hand - and perhaps to tip the balance in our favor."
fngconf.5.a:0 "Demand observer status."
fngconf.5.b:0 "Don't bother."

fngconf.5.t.FNG:0 "Japan Demands Observer Status"
fngconf.5.d.FNG:0 "The Japanese ambassador recently contacted us with a polite but firm request to lead an observer delegation to the National Reunification Conference, insisting that they merely intend to oversee the development of Asian affairs at this historic turning point. We, of course, will welcome our friends from Tokyo with open arms."
fngconf.5.c:0 "Very well, take a seat."

fngconf.6.t:0 "Invite Chen Jiongming?"
fngconf.6.d:0 "Chen Jiongming is one of relatively few individuals who can claim to operate at the highest level of national politics, and from his stronghold in the south he's remained the federalist movement's leading figure for over two decades. Chen Jiongming's ideals and our government's practices have relatively little in common, but there is room for compromise. Chen's presence would grant the federalists a major say in the conference's outcome, but not allowing him to attend could make the process seem illegitimate to some."
fngconf.6.a:0 "Send the invite."
fngconf.6.b:0 "Don't bother."

fngconf.7.t:0 "Invite Song Qingling?"
fngconf.7.d:0 "The third wife of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Song Qingling has previously served as the leading figurehead for the Left-Kuomtintang, and granted the movement her husband's legitimacy even beyond his deathbed. With her organization militarily defeated, Song could pass the same legitimacy on to us, if at the cost of some concessions to her socialist ideals. Nontheless, members of the Concordia Association, the Communications Clique, and even some of the Old Marshal's loyalists are urging us not to invite such a radical firebrand into our midst."
fngconf.7.a:0 "Send the invite."
fngconf.7.b:0 "Don't bother."

fngconf.8.t:0 "Japan Lodges A Complaint"
fngconf.8.d:0 "An official from the Japanese embassy in Shenyang has lodged a formal complaint on behalf of the government in Tokyo, expressing displeasure with our decision to invite 'radical' elements to the conference. He noted that Japan hopes this 'mistake' will not lead to any disruptions in the otherwise 'cordial' Sino-Japanese relationship. Be that as it may, we'll go ahead with matters as planned."

fngconf.9.a:0 "Welcome!"

fngconf.10.t:0 "The National Reunification Conference Begins"
fngconf.10.d:0 "With the arrival of the delegates, the Reunification Conference has officially started with an opening ceremony befitting such a landmark event. After a brief address by the Old Marshal himself, welcoming those attending and underscoring the importance of this historic gathering, the delegates took to their seats. While a promising start, the negotiations over the coming days will no doubt be challenging."
fngconf.10.a:0 "Let's begin."

fngconf.11.t:0 "Tiaoyuan's Speech"
fngconf.11.d:0 "In Beijing, one of the key moments on today's agenda was a speech given by Chen Tiaoyuan, the former governor of Anhui Province who rose to prominence during the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces. He congratulated the Fengtian government's efforts under [FNG.GetLeader] to resist German imperialism, as well as their many lackeys who put the interests of foreigners ahead of fellow Chinese, but warned that he expects the same stubborn resistance against any other foreign aggressors. The speech was met with applause from every corner of the chamber, though some interpreted the speech as a subtle criticism of Zhang Zuolin's ties to the Japanese."
fngconf.11.a:0 "Well spoken."

fngconf.12.t:0 "Question Of The Constitution"
fngconf.12.d.federalist:0 "As the conference started, the first order of this day was the proposed creation of a new constitution. The proposal would clearly outline the rights and powers given to both the people and the government, but not everyone is pleased. Chen Jiongming has expectedly proven a full-throated critic of the proposal in its present form, which he claims would grant too much power to the nation's executive. Instead he would prefer the restoration of the suspended 1923 constitution, which is widely considered China's most liberal to date. The federalist bloc quickly lined up behind Chen, and this will no doubt remain a thorny issue as the conference goes on."
fngconf.12.d.no_federalist:0 "As the conference started, the first order of this day was the proposed creation of a new constitution. While it may not be what everyone wanted, it seems to be something everyone can agree on, or at the very least accept, as it clearly defines the rights, powers and limitations set on the government's branches. After some debate and a few proposed amendments, it seems like it's broadly being agreed upon. Some commenters have noted that the relative equanimity shown is a sign that few present plan to follow the constitution's actual tenets in the long term."
fngconf.12.a:0 "The debate begins."
fngconf.12.b:0 "Interesting."

fngconf.13.t:0 "Disagreements With The Federalists"
fngconf.13.d:0 "Disagreements over the constitution have been center floor to the confernce virtually since its start, and now the Federalists have been joined by other delegates who, while they may not share the same concerns as the Federalists, have used this opportunity to get some of their more minor concerns addressed.\n\nWhile they would likely have accepted the proposed constitution it as it was, the staunch opposition mounted by the Federalists over this issue has allowed them to join forces and form a sizable albeit informal opposition bloc in the conference halls, large enough to hold up the rest of the conference. It would seem that proceedings have stalled until either side budges or offers a compromise."

The 1923 constitution will be broadly restored as it is but with clear checks on a weakened executive along with a centralized army. To accept this compromise Chen Jiongming demands the position of Prime Minister under Zhang Xueliang as President. Under this proposal, Zhang Zuolin would also get the title of Grand Marshal of the army.\n\nWhile it's a tough pill to swallow, it's unlikely that we'll get a much better deal out of them. As such, many in our camp are suggesting that we accept it as even a handful of defections could give their bloc a majority. Others are, however, insisting that we should call the Federalists bluff and that Chen's demands to be the prime minister are unreasonable. How should we act?"

fngconf.16.d:0 "With her very presence at the conference controversial, the Kuomintang luminary's speech was inevitably going to draw a lot of attention. Despite the total defeat of her organization militarily, her late husband's legacy still carries with it the sympathies of many republicans and intellectuals across the country, making her support a valuable commodity - especially for Zhang Zuolin, who continues to seek external legitimacy. Predictably, Song Qingling denounced the inability of previous regimes to address the real wants and needs of the population, and declared that any truly legitimate Chinese government must succeed where its predecessors failed. Her words drew some polite applause from other delegates, but there's no doubt that her eventual proposed reforms will prove controversial with the more conservative delegates."

fngconf.17.d:0 "Most warlords have had a shaky relationship with the ideology of Dr. Sun Yat-sen both before and after his death in 1925. Several, including Zhang Zuolin, have at times claimed to be inheritors of his legacy, keen to draw support from his former adherents despite their own indifference to the ideas themselves. Now, however, Zhang may have to pick a side a stick with it. Among Song Qingling's demands are the formal adoption of the Three Principles of the People, which in theory would force Zhang to turn his back on the Japanese, implement democratic reforms, and commit to widespread social programs.\n\nReality suggests compromise as the only route forward, and fortunately the principles are open to interpretation. Already the Fengtian camp has indicated its willingness to support the first and third of the three principles, if the second is only nominally implemented. Zhang will promise to take a hard-line with the Japanese, fund some of Song's welfare initiatives, and place his son Xueliang as President of the Republic, so long as real power remains in his hands via the military."

The promised ascendency of Zhang Zuolin and his son Xueliang has been seen by conservatives as a sufficient safeguard against radicalism, and a sign that while times are changing China's traditional values will be respected rather than uprooted.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the negotiations ended with Song expressing her gratitude towards Fengtian for their willingness to cooperate and compromise. She has pledged her personal support for Zuolin's initiative to unify China, handing him a powerful tool with which to curry legitimacy on the national stage."
fngconf.18.a:0 "Excellent."

fngconf.18.t.failure:0 "Divided Over Principles"
fngconf.18.d.failure:0 "Evidently, the number of social and political reforms required to appease Song Qiongling has proven too bitter of a pill for Fengtian and its allies to swallow, while Song herself refused to 'desecrate' the legacy of her husband with the aims of an upstart warlord and former bandit.\n\nSubsequently the negotiations ended in failure, and Song Qingling promptly left Beijing and returned to China's political wilderness. While it may not be a huge surprise that this wide ideological rift couldn't be bridged, it's nonetheless a blow to the idea of Chinese unity and Zhang Zuolin's quest for national legitimacy."

By joining the anti-concessionists, we would be directly opposing our nominal friends in Tokyo, and the act would constitute a betrayal in many eyes.

As the situation worsened, the city itself became a battlefield, and the wounds caused by the last battle over the ancient city were quickly reopened as gunfire and shelling marked its streets.\n\nEven before the enemy entered the city, measures were taken to evacuate the delegates, and it wasn't long until these hastily drawn evacuation plans had to be put into effect. By the end of the same week, the Fengtian Army had been chased out of the city.\n\nThe conference collapsed before the city fell, and with it disappeared any hope of the participants returning.
