language_issue_desc:0 "수세기 동안 러시아가 우크라이나를 지배하고 우크라이나어를 억압한 덕분에 우크라이나에서 러시아어를 사용하는 소수 민족, 심지어 다수인들이 생겨났습니다. 독립과 더불어, 우크라이나어는 러시아 정부에 저항하거나 심지어 러시아 통치로의 복귀를 원하고있는 수많은 소러시아인들의 억울함에 비교해서 훨씬 더 활기를 되찾았습니다."

### Events ###
ukraine.1.t:0 "우리의 왕국"
ukraine.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Ukraine proclaimed its independence with German support on 25th January 1918, a state of affairs that was quickly ratified by the Peace of Nations agreement at Brest-Litovsk. An initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People's Republic was swiftly expunged by a German-backed coup. This operation, led by the strongman and former general in the Russian army Pavlo Skoropadsky, set the tone for Ukraine's future. It was to be a breadbasket used by a military-aristocrat elite from across Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic. For a time the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally over Ukrainian rumbled on after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise whereby King Vasily, an Austrian archduke born Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadsky, who as the German-allied 'Hetman', holds incredible powers of both civil and military affairs. By 1927, German involvement in the Austrian Ausgleich negotiations meant that Ukraine fell de-facto into the hands of the Hetman, with King Vasily becoming an increasingly marginalised figure. Ukraine under the Hetmanate has become the breadbasket of the Reichspakt, and made its wealthy landowners exorbinantly wealthy, but at the expense of the Ukrainian peasantry. Now, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg the national situation is unstable. The Reich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to nations within its sphere of influence while Syndicalists gain popularity amongst the downtrodden rural poor and city workers with each passing day. Both ethnic Russians and the pro-Russian population dream of unification with our former master to the East while Ukrainian nationalists proclaim that our Kingdom is no more than a German puppet. This is a immutable truth. Despite these many issues afflicting us, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people industrious and our potential boundless."
ukraine.1.a:0 "우크라이나의 영광은 사라지지 않으리!"
ukraine.2.t:0 "우크라이나 정부"
ukraine.2.d:0 "It is fair to say that our government is divided. While Pavel Skoropadsky does his best to solve the antagonism between the army, consisting of former officers of the Russian Imperial Army, and the civil administration, most of which actively supports our current position in the Reichspakt, many of Ukraine's problems can only be solved when the majority of our population - the kulaks and peasants - have an opportunity to sell their substantial agricultural produce in Europe beyond the narrow confines of the Reichspakt."
ukraine.2.a:0 "농민들을 자극하지 않도록 하자!"
ukraine.3.t:0 "검은 월요일이 우크라이나를 강타하다!"
ukraine.3.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into the abyss, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now that the crash's shock waves have reached the Ukraine, German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ukrainian Hrivna is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking exponentially."
ukraine.3.a:0 "유럽이 우리에게 계속 개방적이기를 바라자."
ukraine.4.t:0 "농업 위기!"
ukraine.4.d:0 "Since the Weltkrieg, Ukraine has traditionally relied upon its valuable grain trade with the German Empire in order to maintain its economic security. Unfortunately the current socio-economic issues afflicting the Reich have meant that it is now far more interested in protecting its own farmers than taking the politically unpopular move of subsidising Ukrainian agriculture. This could be very dangerous for us as without support from the German market, our ruling class of agrarian landowners could find it difficult to maintain their dominance in the countryside."
ukraine.4.a:0 "우리는 아직 유럽의 빵 바구니다, 맞지?"
ukraine.5.t:0 "신앙과 국가"
ukraine.5.d:0 "Before the agricultural crisis pro-Russian movements were rather weak and disunited, ensuring they didn't pose much of a threat to our government. This crisis has led to a shocking rise in popular support for these organisations and an increase in their willingness to cooperate. Yesterday a famous Russian writer from Kiev, Mikhail Bulgakov, proclaimed the unification of the three largest movements into a singular organisation known as 'Faith and Nation' ('Vera i Narod') or just 'ViN'. Supported by the Ukrainian Church, itself heavily influenced by the Moscow Patriarchate, the population of Southern and Eastern Ukraine and many high-ranking officers, this movement could provoke serious instability in some parts of our country."
ukraine.5.a:0 "우리는 반드시 항의해야 한다!"
ukraine.6.t:0 "이반 체르냐홉스키가 아프리카에서 귀환하다"
ukraine.6.d:0 "Ivan Chernyakhovsky, a young and talented officer, has returned to Ukraine. He was a member of the voluntary Ukrainian division, which supported our German allies in regional conflicts in the Mittelafrikan bush. His books 'On the Banks of the Congo' and 'Safari' previously made him the most popular Ukrainian soldier and writer in the entire country. Chernyakhovsky has been promoted to the rank of Colonel and will soon become the commander of the 1st Cossack Division ('Serdyutskaya'), which ensures this popular figure will command an elite branch of the Ukrainian army."
ukraine.6.a:0 "잘 돌아왔다 이반!"
ukraine.7.t:0 "드미트리 돈초프가 갈리치아-로도메리아에서 추방당하다"
ukraine.7.d:0 "Dmitri Dontsov, an renowned ideologue of Ukrainian nationalism, has been deported from Galicia, where he had urged the local Ukrainian minority to resist the Austro-Hungarian administration. He now claims that our silence on the crisis has exposed the weakness of our government, and that's why Ukraine should be ruled by 'real Ukrainian patriots'. His slogan 'Ukraine for the Ukrainians' is attractive to many citizens, especially in Western Ukraine, and graffiti has been spotted in a number of towns. This could be dangerous for the cabinet, since we've already lost considerable support in the East."
ukraine.7.a:0 "엄... 잘 돌아왔다?"
ukraine.8.t:0 "Khrushchev criticises the Ukrainian government."
ukraine.8.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev, a prominent Ukrainian social democrat, has opened the 3rd Congress of the Ukrainian Syndicalist Party. He demands that the government takes extreme measures to defend the workers and peasants from poverty brought on by the global crash. To further this agenda he has proposed a new programme of major social and economic reforms aimed at helping Ukraine overcome the crisis. The controversial figure is going to present his plan in the Rada soon."
ukraine.8.a:0 "Extreme measures? This stinks of Bolshevikism!"
ukraine.9.t:0 "Our Future"
ukraine.9.d:0 "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and the stability of many of the nation's most important institutions. The King's grip on the country is weakening by the hour, peasants loyal to the Hetman want major land reform, pro-Russian malcontents and Ukrainian nationalists demand radical measures and the Syndicalists are mobilising workers all over the country. Various political movements struggle for power in our teetering nation, and soon we have to choose who will lead Ukraine into the future."
ukraine.9.a:0 "Ukraine will stagger on as it always has!"
ukraine.10.t:0 "Khrushchev's Speech"
ukraine.10.d:0 "As one of the few social democrats in the Rada, Nikita Khrushchev wields an mesmerising degree of influence over the Ukrainian peasantry and urban rabble. He has taken advantage of our troubles in a recent speech, where he has openly called for sweeping land reforms, an extension of the electoral franchise and an end to landlord dominance in the countryside. These demands are extremely popular among the lower classes, and are giving them ideas dangerous to national stability. Despite this, perhaps we could make use of Khrushchev's popularity and allow him to become the face of economic reforms unpopular amongst the rural landlords that we would otherwise take a political hit over anyway."
ukraine.10.a:0 "Dismiss Skoropadsky and invite Khrushchev to head a popular government."
ukraine.11.t:0 "The Language Issue"
ukraine.11.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev has joined the government as leader during one of the darkest periods in our nation's history since 1918. However, before solving the economic problems it is imperative that Khrushchev respond to the burgeoning pro-Russian movement, which has had a malign impact on our electorate in industrial Ukraine. One method that could help neutralise their popularity is by addressing the language question, a domestic dilemma that has been lingering for years. The Russian language is used de-facto by a substantial percentage of the population, however its usage is expressly prohibited in state institutions. This has given rise to accusations that Russians are treated as second-class citizens."
ukraine.11.a:0 "Make Russian the second official state language."
ukraine.11.b:0 "Arrest important pro-Russian leaders."
ukraine.12.t:0 "National-Syndicalists Protest!"
ukraine.12.d:0 "Notable Ukrainian National-Syndicalists Vlas Chubar and Alexander Shumsky oppose Khrushchev's decision to allow the usage of the Russian language in administrative institutions. They claim that this measure won't help to unify our country and that unopposed usage of the Russian language will lead to the growth of the separatist organisations in Southern and Eastern Ukrainian."
ukraine.12.a:0 "Millions of our workers don't think so."
ukraine.12.b:0 "All right, all right. Restore the status quo"
ukraine.13.t:0 "Pro-Russian Leaders Stir Up Trouble"
ukraine.13.d:0 "Leaders of the different pro-Russian movements have unfortunately managed to escape Ukrainian soil before they could be arrested. Many have sought temporary exile in Romania and Russia, with both nations somewhat hostile to our pro-German regime and aware of the Kaiser's gaze turning west. Mikhail Bulgakov has announced publicly that the nationalist umbrella organisation 'Faith and Nation' is ready to fight for the rights of Russians in Ukraine. Maybe we have made a big mistake."
ukraine.13.a:0 "Another problem!"
ukraine.14.t:0 "Profits From Increased Taxation on the Kulaks"
ukraine.14.d:0 "Our decision to raise taxes on the Kulak landlords and spend this money on the poorest peasants has helped to stabilise our agriculture sector. 60-70% of the state and private farms are estimated to now be entirely self-supporting. As a result of our increased support from the villages and farms we can turn to other pressing issues with our faltering economy."
ukraine.14.a:0 "That's one fire extinguished."
ukraine.15.t:0 "Another Crisis!"
ukraine.15.d:0 "Our government's decision to divide the property of the Kulaks has led to a second crisis among the farmers. Our collectivisation attempts have ended in a total failure, with agricultural yields from the new collectivised farms cumulatively less than the smallholdings that they replaced. Unbelievably the situation in Ukraine has managed to deteriorate even further!"
ukraine.15.a:0 "Proof that Syndicalism doesn't always work."
ukraine.16.t:0 "The Fate of the Ukrainian Monarchy"
ukraine.16.d:0 "His Majesty King Vasily I Vyshyvaniy gave Nikita Khrushchev extensive powers in a bid to control the revolutionary trends sweeping the country in the aftermath of the crisis. Now that Khrushchev's initial programme has been implemented successfully, many interest groups within Ukraine have begun debating the continued prominence of the monarchy considering its relative powerlessness in the face of recent crises."
ukraine.16.a:0 "The bourgeoisie like liberty, but would prefer a less radical government."
ukraine.16.b:0 "The poor love Khrushchev, but hate the King! Long live the Republic!"
ukraine.17.t:0 "A New Minister of Security?"
ukraine.17.d:0 "Igor Kistyakovsky has been our minister of Security since 1918 but recently had to retire from his post because of his poor health. 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have immediately started fighting for this position because each party hopes to increase their influence over Ukrainian internal policy. We have to give 'ViN' or 'OUN' this post, according to the power-sharing agreement concluded before the elections."
ukraine.17.a:0 "Vladimir Khitrovo from 'ViN'"
ukraine.17.b:0 "Vladimir Chekhovsky from 'OUN'"
ukraine.17.c:0 "Daniil Skoropadsky, son of our Hetman"
ukraine.18.t:0 "Free Trade Area With the Ukraine"
ukraine.18.d:0 "The new Ukrainian government has sought to reconstruct the economy by establishing a free trade area between the Ukraine and the Russian market. This virtual erasure of eye-watering tarrifs and customs duties at the border would be a substantial boon for our own merchants and industrialists. Furthermore, opening up the largely agrarian Ukrainian market to Russian importers desperate to feed the austerity-hit masses in Russia's major cities would massively boost our economy..."
ukraine.18.a:0 "Launch this project!"
ukraine.19.t:0 "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
ukraine.19.d:0 "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands, which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg, are now home to a number of new collieries and ironworks and our urban poor now have access to cheap Ukrainian grain to supplement their diet. The unemployment rate has been reduced substantially in certain key sectors. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
ukraine.19.a:0 "Great"
ukraine.20.t:0 "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
ukraine.20.d:0 "The free trade area with Russia has shown its benefits. The borderlands, which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg, are now home to a number of new collieries and ironworks and our grain, previously rotting in the fields, now has access to a massive market in the form of the Russian urban poor. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
ukraine.20.a:0 "Great"
ukraine.21.t:0 "Prosvita is Effective!"
ukraine.21.d:0 "The activities of the Prosvita Movement have had a demonstrably positive influence on our youth, with membership numbers soaring into the hundreds of thousands at least.

ukraine.23.t:0 "Ukraine Request Recovery Aid"
ukraine.23.d:0 "The Ukrainian government has asked us for a relatively substantial loan, which they wish to use for the electrification of the poorest grain-growers. One of our major Reichspakt allies and the bastion of our Ostwall against a Russian resurgence, Ukraine's situation is already incredibly unstable, in part due to our protectionist measures during Black Week that proved detrimental to Ukrainian agriculture."
ukraine.23.a:0 "Very well. Grant them the money."
ukraine.23.b:0 "Who cares about Ukraine?"
ukraine.24.t:0 "Germany Grants Us a Loan!"
ukraine.24.d:0 "The German Empire has accepted our request! Now we can invest this money into the electrification of the villages in Central Ukraine, which promises to increase our support amongst the peasantry, boost our agricultural productivity and improve our rural economy. Germany's decision is perhaps not surprising. Ukraine is, after all, a much better place to invest in than Poland!"

ukraine.25.t:0 "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.25.d:0 "With the aid of loans from the German government, our government has finally been able to electrify virtually all of the villages in Central Ukraine, greatly improving the agricultural yields of our peasant farms.

ukraine.27.t:0 "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.27.d:0 "Even though Germany refused to grant us loans, our government has finally been able to electrify virtually all of the villages in Central Ukraine through increased taxation, greatly improving the agricultural yields of our peasant farms. As a result of this and our previous measures Ukraine has finally begun to recover from the crushing effects of Black Monday."
ukraine.27.a:0 "It was worth it."
ukraine.28.t:0 "Another Ukrainian Loan"
ukraine.28.d:0 "The Ukrainian government asked us for a loan again, which they want to use for the industrialisation of the Eastern part of the Ukraine to quell Syndicalist power there. However, the size of this loan is much bigger than the one before. Many senior personnel in our administration believe that the rise of Syndicalism in Ukraine is a direct threat to Reichspakt solidarity."

ukraine.29.t:0 "Germany Granted Us Another Loan"

ukraine.30.t:0 "Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine"
ukraine.30.d:0 "Many workers in Eastern Ukraine have gotten new jobs in emerging industries due to our investment there, funded by the loan from Germany. As a result our loyalty amongst the urban poor has grown immensely, greatly neutering the power of the Syndicalist movement there. We have recovered from Black Monday, while also crippling the power base of the trade unions!"

ukraine.31.t:0 "Germany Refused A Second Loan!"
ukraine.31.d:0 "The Germany Empire is not going to help us with investment in our industrial East, shortsightedly forgetting that the more power Syndicalism gains in Eastern Europe, the greater the threat to their interests. We must choose whether to increase our taxes or abandon this plan entirely."
ukraine.31.a:0 "Time to raise taxes."
ukraine.31.b:0 "It's too damn expensive!"
ukraine.32.t:0 "The Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine"
ukraine.32.d:0 "Many workers in Eastern Ukraine have gotten new jobs in emerging industries due to our investment there, funded by extra taxes levied on the population.

They cannot start the reform of their industry alone and they have turned to friendly nations overseas for help. There are some plans that have been proposed by our economy minister - the question is which one should we choose?"

Many hotheads in the general staff have suggesed direct military action to punish the new Syndicalist government and deter other potential insurrectionists. Doing so could be extremely unwise however as Ukraine possesses one of the largest armed forces in Europe and they are critical for our long-term plans as a bulwark against a belligerent Russia. Members of the Abwehr have instead suggested that we ought to use our ties with many senior Ukrainian army officials to instigate a reactionary coup d'etat in Kiev. The choice now is how we should react to this clear betrayal."
ukraine.34.a:0 "We do not have the resources to respond."

ukraine.35.t:0 "German Military Mission Leaves the Ukraine"
ukraine.35.d:0 "Following our decision to leave the hated the Reichspakt bloc, the German military mission present in our country since 1918 has finally left! Already, officers and advisers that had been stationed on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol and the capital Kiev, have been surreptitiously evacuated over the course of the day. This is truly a testament to an independent Ukraine."
ukraine.35.a:0 "The chains are broken, for now at least."
ukraine.36.t:0 "'Arsenal'"
ukraine.36.d:0 "On January 29, 1918, the workers of the factory 'Arsenal' in Kiev organised an armed pro-Bolshevik mutiny known as a January Rebellion against the Central Rada, the Ukrainian assembly that declared the independence of Ukraine during the Russian Civil War. Since then, the government has failed to interfere with the poor administration of the factory, fearing their actions accidentally sparking a worker's revolt in Kiev. After the triumph of Syndicalism in Ukraine however, the French Commune has decided to help us with the revival of the factory. 'Arsenal' will mainly produce artillery, anti-tank, and anti-aircraft guns, all of which our nation, surrounded by forces hostile to our revolutionary ideology, desperately need."
ukraine.36.a:0 "God bless the French."
ukraine.37.t:0 "Ukraine Requests To Join The Internationale"
ukraine.37.d:0 "The government of the Ukraine have recently announced their intention of joining the Syndicalist bloc in the face of German reactionism in Eastern Europe. Unlike the vast majority of Internationale members Ukraine's Syndicalist government stems not from revolutionary activity, but working with monarchists and German stooges in government - making them most unorthodox. Still, Ukrainian peasants would be useful in the crusade against the bloodthirsty Germans and Canadian pigs."
ukraine.37.a:0 "Together we shall envelop the hated Bosche!"

ukraine.39.t:0 "Attempt at a Military Coup"
ukraine.39.d:0 "German agitators, with the help of reactionary officers and a part of our armed forces, have launched a coup against our government and are trying to restore the pro-German regime in Ukraine. Elements of the Military Mission that had previously been deployed in key garrisons on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol port and in the capital joined forces with pro-German troops and have started running street battles near the ministry buildings. The country is in absolute chaos and liable to deteriorate further, with the survival of Syndicalism in Ukraine on a knife-edge. How will the situation develop?"

ukraine.39.b:0 "The Red militias successfully defend Kiev!"
ukraine.40.t:0 "Reactionary Coup in the Ukraine Succeeds"
ukraine.40.d:0 "Members of the German Military Mission together, with reactionary members of the Ukrainian armed forces, have successfully seized control of Kiev, overthrowing the Syndicalist government and replacing it with one again loyal to the German Empire. After a number of street battles and open warfare raging in government buildings, the putschists began purging Reds wherever they could find them. A nervous King Vasily was given sweeping powers by a pliant Rada and again signed Ukraine up as a formal member of the Reichspakt. We have successfully prevented the poison of Syndicalism from spreading any further in Eastern Europe, and for this the Abwehr should be commended."
ukraine.40.a:0 "Excellent!"
ukraine.41.t:0 "우크라이나 군사 쿠데타가 실패하다"
ukraine.41.d:0 "Our attempt to replace the government in Ukraine with one loyal to our state has failed miserably. Though our Military Mission staff and a number of anti-Syndicalist elements of the Ukrainian army managed to launch a coup d'etat in Kiev and seize a number of government buildings, they were swiftly overwhelmed by Red militias and executed en-masse.

The French government has proposed an excellent idea that aligns with his thinking. The Commune has offered to invest in the largest nationalised brewing facility in Europe, allowing us to greatly expand it and lower the price of cheap alcohol. The expansion of the factory, named 'Obolon', will definitely give us increased support among the low and middle classes of the Ukrainian society. After all, who doesn't like alcohol?"

ukraine.43.d:0 "Though the Commune of France knows about our internal problems, it seems that they are not going to help us... at least for the moment.

'ViN' and 'OUN' support Daniil as they believe he will weaken Ukrainian dependence on the Reichspakt by virtue of his lack of royal ties with the European dynasties.

The main characters are the Russian officers and Ukrainian citizens that participated in the defence of Kiev from those disloyal to the new regime of Ukrainian Nationalists and different socialist groups comprised of soldiers in the army of Hetman Skoropadsky. The film analyses the relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians.

The film, which was conceived to be an answer to the Bulgakov's 'White Guard' doesn't try to point out possible methods of reconciliation, but raises by implication the potential for separatists and spies of foreign powers to still be hiding among the Ukrainian population and both willing and able to try to exploit its weakness."

Since they are the only group of the farmers that are still able to fulfil our consumer needs, it would be wise to let them have their lands, but to impose an additional tax on them."
UKR_Coll_Prog:0 "집산화"
UKR_Coll_Prog_desc:0 "After the latest agricultural crisis among the 'Kulaks', we have many new poor peasants all over Ukraine. Khrushchev proposes that they can work on new collective farms and produce goods for the state, which will provide them with farming tools and pay them a reasonable salary. This should hopefully, through pooling of resources, boost our total output."
UKR_Fate_Monarchy:0 "왕실의 운명"
UKR_Fate_Monarchy_desc:0 "King Vasily has become somewhat of a laughing stock to the Ukrainian people. By handing major powers to Krushchev and seeing more issues solved in months than the King himself had resolved in years he has only highlighted his own irrelevance. A former Austrian puppet king with no Austrian backing, his position is being openly debated by Popular Front members."
UKR_Syn_Rev:0 "붉은 헤트만"
UKR_Syn_Rev_desc:0 "As the great Hetman Bogdan Khmelnitsky, who once liberated people on both banks of the Dnieper from the Polish yoke, once did; Nikita Khrushchev and the Popular Front deposed the King, the Hetman, and purged the Rada of all elements not willing to embrace the new reality. Finally the people of Ukraine are ready to build new society, one both proud and free!"
UKR_Friendship_Nations:0 "국가들의 친선"
UKR_Friendship_Nations_desc:0 "The capitalists did their best to divide the people of Ukraine, imposing chauvinism and intolerance on the national minorities of our country. But new leadership with Khrushchev is ready to fight this deception and will encourage a policy of friendship with people from all nations. That's how the people of Ukraine will cooperate for a better future!"
UKR_Khrushchyovka:0 "'흐루시초프카'"
UKR_Khrushchyovka_desc:0 "'Khrushchyovka' is the unofficial designation for a type of low-cost, concrete-panelled three to five-storied apartment building developed at the request of our leader Nikita Khrushchev. Mass production of these structures should finally solve the housing problem in the rapidly expanding Ukrainian cities and will provide more employment and accommodation to the masses."
UKR_Remove_Khrushchev:0 "좌파를 정화하다"
UKR_Remove_Khrushchev_desc:0 "The recent denigration of the royal position has demonstrated that Krushchev and his Popular Front partners are an unacceptable threat to King and Country. We will remove them from all of their offices in a major purge with the Hetman's backing. Once done, we will have to abolish their most radical laws and start to re-calibrate our economy."

UKR_Broad_Coalition:0 "국수주의자들과 동맹을 맺다"
UKR_Broad_Coalition_desc:0 "Realising the scale of the Syndicalist threat, Hetman Skoropadsky decided to strike a bargain with the pro-Russian 'ViN' and nationalist 'OUN'. Both parties will get freedom of action in regions where they are especially popular, but in return they will support Skoropadsky's regime and the King in the Rada through a 'confidence and supply' agreement."
UKR_Rightist_Government:0 "초기적 행정 개혁"
UKR_Rightist_Government_desc:0 "Members of 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have begun to replace Hetman-period officials in the regions en-masse, somewhat upsetting the balance of the Rada. Surprisingly, this has had a positive effect on our economy because eager new local governments are keen to solve the problems afflicting their own towns. The first steps of reform are underway."
UKR_ViN_Russophiles:0 "교회와 국가"
UKR_ViN_Russophiles_desc:0 "It seems that Mikhail Bulgakov, with the help of 'ViN', has finally found a method by which the land question can be resolved amicably. The Ukrainian Church, which is a part of the Russian Orthodox Church, will sell vast swathes of mostly unoccupied lands to the peasants at a discount, but Orthodoxy will be recognised as the formal state religion in Ukraine."
UKR_OUN_Nationalists:0 "폴란드인 농장 징발"
UKR_OUN_Nationalists_desc:0 "A number of Polish landlords control land in Western and Central Ukraine for historical reasons. Since Poland is decidedly weak now, we can easily confiscate their estates, expel these Poles, and redistribute their lands among the Ukrainian peasants. This should also coincidentally appeal to nationalist supporters of both stripes that generally detest the Polish minority."
UKR_Abolish_Law:0 "러시아어를 인정"
UKR_Abolish_Law_desc:0 "One of the biggest problems which exists in Ukraine is the language question. De-facto, the Russian language is used by a majority of the population, but its usage is prohibited by the state institutions. 'ViN' has always opposed this prohibition and thus it is with great pleasure that Mikhail Bulgakov is now able to abolish this language law."
UKR_Prosvita_Mov:0 "프로스비타 운동"
UKR_Prosvita_Mov_desc:0 "Unfortunately, a sizeable percentage of our population use the Russian language despite the fact that the government doesn't recognise it at a state level for use in national institutions. To combat this, 'OUN' has proposed to invest in a 'Prosvita' ('Education') movement. The aim of 'Prosvita' is to spread Ukrainian language and culture throughout the country, as well as abroad."
UKR_Free_Trade:0 "동유럽 자유무역지대"
UKR_Free_Trade_desc:0 "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg are full of collieries and ironworks now. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
UKR_Resettlement:0 "재정착"
UKR_Resettlement_desc:0 "The Ukrainian nation is still divided, even though Ukraine itself has been an independent country for almost 20 years. We should address this situation by resettling peasants from Western Ukraine to the East, where they will become workers in the Donbass industrial region. This also will also serve to bring Ukrainian ideas and traditions into this unfriendly 'OUN' region."
UKR_Crisis_Coalition:0 "동맹의 위기"
UKR_Crisis_Coalition_desc:0 "Though the Syndicalist threat has mostly melted away due to government reforms, 'ViN' and 'OUN' have gained too much popularity among the citizens of Ukraine and their followers are inadvertently violently splitting our country apart with their nationalistic fervour. This situation cannot continue as the situation in Europe is quickly deteriorating."

UKR_Dissolve_Rada:0 "라다 해체"
UKR_Dissolve_Rada_desc:0 "Our Supreme Rada (Parliament) has always been too left and never really supported Skoropadsky's policies as Hetman. The King has been shaken out of his legislative stupor to grant Skoropadsky the authority to dissolve the Rada and form instead a loyal State Senate, stacked primarily with regime puppets and useful officials from different Ukrainian regions."
UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy:0 "우크라이나 통일"
UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy_desc:0 "The relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians in Ukraine are good enough, but various powers try to depict them as an eternal struggle between the West and the East. We must stop this chauvinistic propaganda, but our aim is also to show that despite the common past and good relations with Russia, we are independent now and will always be."
UKR_Army_Reforms:0 "직업군"
UKR_Army_Reforms_desc:0 "It is obvious that the Ukrainian army is incomparable to the Russian and German behemoths, and yet it is still stronger than any neighbouring army. That's why Skoropadsky has proposed re-orientating our army towards a smaller professional force. It will help us maintain our security, and will allow us to reduce our costly defence spending."
UKR_Peasant_State:0 "농민 국가"
UKR_Peasant_State_desc:0 "Our peasants have always played a significant role in the country and its economy. With extra money available from our reduced military spending, we can reduce taxes for the poor until our agriculture recovers from Black Monday and we will become the breadbasket of Europe once again."
UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism:0 "생디칼리즘 금지"
UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism_desc:0 "We have reached an understanding with the pro-Russian circles, pacified the various Ukrainian movements and helped make the peasantry loyal to us. Now we have to deal with the Syndicalists. Our mass media will start a massive propaganda campaign, showing the Syndies as a malignant tumour on Slavdom. Our efforts will eventually enable us to ban many notorious left parties."
UKR_Federalisation:0 "연방화"
UKR_Federalisation_desc:0 "The Syndicalists, Nationalists and the Russophiles have all tried to impose their ideas on the whole country. This has demonstrated the flaws of the centralised approach of the Hetmanate. If we give our regions more autonomy and weaken the Supreme Rada, we will be able to stop regional debates becoming flashpoints on the national stage to ensure political chaos remains a thing of the past."

UKR_New_Heir:0 "계승 문제"
UKR_New_Heir_desc:0 "King Vasily, as vigorous in his production of heirs as in running the country, has left the royal succession up for debate. There are only two realistic contenders, Leo Stefan Habsburg or Daniil Skoropadsky. Neither are completely ideal but this question must be solved sooner rather than later."
UKR_Explosion_Dnieper:0 "드네프르에서의 폭발"

UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty:0 "페레야슬라프 조약"
UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty_desc:0 "With Russian nationalists in charge of the Ukrainian government, the option is now available for us to petition the Russian government for reintegration back into Mother Russia. There is no guarantee that they would risk incurring Germany's wrath by accepting us however."
UKR_OUN_Embargo:0 "독일 금수조치"
UKR_OUN_Embargo_desc:0 "With Ukrainian nationalists dominating the government, the time has come to put the Ukrainian people first - by taking a serious gamble. For too long our nation's economy and agricultural sector has been geared towards serving the Germany people at our own expense. This will end. Protectionism is the only way we can assert ourselves."
UKR_New_Scientists:0 "새로운 과학자"
UKR_New_Scientists_desc:0 "The main aim of Hetman Skoropadsky has always been stability. With a new atmosphere of relative calm descending on the nation our young people are moving into the sciences and many companies are investing into research. We can only support this process."

UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery:0 "우크라이나 복구 시작"
UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery_desc:0 "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Syndicalist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."
UKR_First_Loan:0 "전기화를 위한 독일의 대출"
UKR_First_Loan_desc:0 "We should ask Germany for a loan, which we will be able to use for the electrification of the the poorest grain-growers. By doing so we will improve their living conditions and help modernise their production methods. They must understand that the situation in Ukraine is unstable and it is important to help us, since we secure German interests in the East."
UKR_First_TaxHike:0 "전기화를 위한 세금"
UKR_First_TaxHike_desc:0 "We must use our own resources and raise taxes, since there is no other way to get investment for the programme of the electrification of the villages in the Central Ukraine. We hope that our peasants will understand us."
UKR_Electrification:0 "새로운 자원"
UKR_Electrification_desc:0 "Our government has finally been able to electrify all the villages in Central Ukraine. As a result our peasants will be able to produce more agricultural goods and supplies. Now we also need more resources, to fuel our nation's recovery and create the tools to do it."
UKR_Second_Loan:0 "산업화를 위한 독일의 대출"
UKR_Second_Loan_desc:0 "We have improved the situation in Central Ukraine - it's time to do something in the Eastern part of the country.

UKR_Second_TaxHike:0 "산업화를 위한 세금"
UKR_Second_TaxHike_desc:0 "Electricity is available all over the Central Ukraine - now it's time to rebuild industry in the Eastern part of the country. All the factories built by the Tsarist government should be modernised as fast as possible. And that's why we have to raise taxes. Again."

UKR_Kharkov_Industry_desc:0 "Kharkov has always been one of the most populated cities in Ukraine, but we have never used this advantage in our economy. Now is a perfect time to launch the formation of a new industrial region in the Kharkov region and finally make our industry strong!"
UKR_Revive_Agriculture:0 "농업 부흥"
UKR_Revive_Agriculture_desc:0 "Our main aim was to turn Ukraine into the breadbasket of Europe and an indispensable partner to Germany and the Reichspakt. On the contrary, we became even more dependent on German goods after Black Monday and our trade deficit widened significantly. Now we must reconstruct our national agriculture market, using our industry and new agricultural tools, to end this sorry state of affairs."
UKR_Donbass_Industry:0 "돈바스 공장 부활"
UKR_Donbass_Industry_desc:0 "After a long period of political turbulence, the situation in Ukraine is more or less stable, and we have a good chance to continue reforms. Our long-term aim is to develop industry in the East of Ukraine. Thanks to the Tsarist regime, we just have to re-open old Donbass factories and modernise them a little or launch the formation of a new industrial region."

UKR_Stab_econ:0 "안정화"

UKR_Reorg_army:0 "새로운 우크라이나 육군"
UKR_Reorg_army_desc:0 "The army of Ukraine is in as poor condition as the Kingdom itself. Although the Black Monday crisis made us reduce the military budget, we still have enough money to launch new reforms, which will allow us to reorganise the Ministry of Defence. It's time to assert our independent military might and secure our borders from Ukraine's numerous rivals."
UKR_Mobile:0 "체르냐호프스키 계획"
UKR_Mobile_desc:0 "Ivan Chernyakhovsky is an young ambitious colonel who has already understood that future wars would be won by heavy industry and machines.

UKR_Mobile_Forces:0 "조국을 위한 트럭"
UKR_Mobile_Forces_desc:0 "Trucks are very important for any modern army - that's why we have to use our industry and build a new model of truck. This should allow us to end our dependence on horse cavalry and cease to be a laughing stock to our major regional foes."

UKR_Tank_Forces_desc:0 "One tank can replace more than ten soldiers on the battlefield - that's why we have to build as many tanks as we can to create one of the strongest armies in Eastern Europe. The wide plains of Ukraine are the perfect environment for their use. We cannot pass this opportunity up."
UKR_Grand_Battle:0 "포위된 국가"
UKR_Grand_Battle_desc:0 "Unfortunately, due to our geographical position our enemies are unlikely to disappear as swiftly as 'water in the Sun' as our national anthem states. Despite this we can still be ready for an any unfriendly action if we prepare our battle plans beforehand. Let's do it!"
UKR_Firepower:0 "천둥과 번개"

UKR_Doct1_desc:0 "A number of wars have happened since the proclamation of our independence in 1918. Russia, China, Central America, Afrika and Brazil. Now is the time we must rethink the lessons these campaigns can teach us to understand our own army's failings and possible remedies."

UKR_Massive_doct_desc:0 "We have many soldiers and many rifles. Some might argue that such an army is weaker than a modern military resplendent with tanks and artillery galore. This could be true, but we will definitely find out which is superior on the battlefield."
UKR_New_Army_UKR:0 "재조직된 군대"
UKR_New_Army_UKR_desc:0 "Finally, the army of Ukraine has been reorganised by the Ministry of Defence and our General Staff. It seems that the army which had been formed after 1918 to maintain the independence of Ukraine has finally come into its own."

UKR_Newforpol_desc:0 "Ukraine has made great strides towards rebooting its frail economy and political systems, and now is the time to pay attention to reorientating our foreign policy.

UKR_Fra_alliance_desc:0 "With Ukraine finally free from German capitalist oppression we can now freely decide our stance towards the international community.
