HON_peasant_republic:0 "농민 공화국"
HON_peasant_republic_desc:0 "농민의 이름으로 의회를 개최하는 온두라스는 '농민 공화국'이며, 정식 명칭은 온두라스 농민 노동자 공화국입니다. 하지만 사실 정부는 빈사상태에 놓여 있고, 국민을 대표하는 역할조차 제대로 하지 못하고 있습니다."

HON_december_revolution_desc:0 "1932년 농민들이 수도를 점령하고 여러 집단들의 느슨한 연대체가 "온두라스 농민 의회"라는 이름으로 집권하면서 12월 혁명이 터졌습니다. 누군가는 혁명이 실패했다고 생각하지만, 다른 이들은 충분히 이루지 못했다고 생각합니다..."
HON_great_purge:0 "대숙청"
HON_great_purge_desc:0 "대숙청은 주로 미국과 연관된 온두라스군 인사에게 가해진 대규모 박해였습니다. 경제적으로 미국의 영향력이 돌아오고 먼로 독트린이 되찾았다는 사실이 드러났고, 이로서 온두라스군이 굉장히 약해졌는데... 아마도 결과는 모두가 추측할 수 있을 겁니다."

honduras.1.t:0 "바나나 공화국 원조"
honduras.1.d:0 "Having come under the domination of various US fruit companies that turned the nation into an economic enclave, Honduras came to a breaking point in 1933. A peasant uprising stormed the capital and lead to the suicide of the sitting president, but even after this catastrophe, the government established in the aftermath of the revolution became dominated once more by US interests and a clique of intelligentsia. Now what remains of Honduras' apparatus of state is a mess, purged of dissenters and relying on military force to keep the railways to the ports open."

honduras.3.d:0 "While ostensibly a member of the Revolutionary Council, Venancio Callejas has always stood somewhat apart from it. Before the emergency session to deal with the political crisis, he held a rally of his supporters in public, both to rally support and as a show of force to both the Army and the Council. Indeed, many whisper that simply handing him and his Redshirts the premiership could inject the vitality that the moribund revolution needs."

honduras.4.t:0 "The Emergency Council Session: Castro's Connections"
honduras.4.d:0 "General Jose Leon Castro has been a key player in rallying military support for the Council for a while now, associating with various officer's cliques and slowly forming his own band of loyalists. It is also well known that despite the anti-American policy of the Revolutionary Council, he and other members are in extensive contact with the United Fruit Company that still grips the economy. There are even murmurs in the Council that his influence would make a military regime preferable to the absolute loss of power that would accompany major reforms."

honduras.5.t:0 "Rallying for Democracy"
honduras.5.d:0 "With the desertions in the Army, the repression of demonstrations has become much more difficult.

honduras.6.t:0 "The Emergency Session"
honduras.6.d:0 "The emergency session of the Honduran Council has begun, to decide the future of the Peasants' Republic. A large crowd has gathered outside of council chambers, with the police unwilling to disperse them. The first task of the Council is to elect a new chairman to set the agenda for the meeting. Council members Callejas and Castro have nearly come to blows over their differing views, and wild accusations are being made by either side, while Councilors Morales and Galvez have formed a united front arguing for the dissolution of the Council and its reformation as an elected body; ultimately there seems to be only a few options..."

honduras.7.t:0 "Our Stake In Honduras"
honduras.7.d:0 "With the recent end of the Second Civil War, the United States can once again begin to look outward and pursue an active foreign policy. As part of that, the United Fruit Company's executives have reached us with disturbing news; the popular council that governs Honduras is currently under siege in their own government building by revolutionary socialists. The government is lobbying for an intervention by our forces; the best course of action would be to send a detachment of Marines in to shore up Jose Leon Castro, a well-regarded military man. There has been a controversial proposal, however, that we might send our troops in to assume more direct control of Honduran affairs..."
honduras.7.a:0 "We would rather not risk it."

Following this coup, General Jose Leon Castro was recognised by the United States as the legitimate President of the Republic of Honduras. Their instructions couldn't be clearer..."

honduras.10.t:0 "미 해병대가 침공하다!"
honduras.10.d:0 "It seems the Council's call for American support might not have been taken the way they thought. Early this morning, US warships shelled Honduran ports and disgorged marines who set about occupying them and declaring a 'Provisional Republican Government' of the country. Venancio Callejas, in response, has lead a militia to seize control of the council chambers and has already had several council members hung."

honduras.11.c:0 "Truth is, the elections were rigged from the start."

honduras.12.t:0 "Del Valle's Assault Fails!"
honduras.12.d:0 "In a dramatic turn of events, it seems the Marine Corps' attempt to seize control of Honduras has been pushed back, with a revolutionary socialist government massacring their Peasants' Council and declaring absolute independence. Some hardliners are arguing that to back down now would be a show of weakness, while others believe we should bide our time."
honduras.12.a:0 "Of course they realize this means war"
honduras.12.b:0 "We don't need to go to war so soon over Honduras."

honduras.13.t:0 "Premier Callejas Takes Control"
honduras.13.d:0 "Having cleared out the last of the opposition and been appointed chairman of the council, the assumption of power by Venancio Callejas has become a fait accompli. His new state promises to be vigorous and progressive and to bring Honduras into the world of 20th century socialism."
honduras.13.a:0 "Long Live The People!"

honduras.14.t:0 "카스트로 장군이 통제권을 장악하다"
