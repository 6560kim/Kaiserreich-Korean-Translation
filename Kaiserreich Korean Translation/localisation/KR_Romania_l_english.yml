romania.0.t:0 "[From.GetName]"
romania.0.d:0 "1878년 카를 왕 아래 루마니아가 오스만 제국으로 부터 독립하고 나서 천천히 현대화를 진행하고 서쪽을 향해 돌아서고 있습니다. 루마니아는 1913년에 제2차 발칸전쟁에 참전했으며, 불가리아의 균형을 무너뜨리고 불가리아로 부터 남부 도브루자를 빼앗았습니다.\n\n1914년 세계대전이 발발했을 때 루마니아는 초창기에는 중립을 지키다가, 1916년에 카를 선왕의 후계자인 페르디난드 1세의 명으로 협상국에 가입했습니다. 트란실바니아 침공 시도가 실패한 이후, 루마니아 전체의 2/3에 달하는 지역을 동맹국이 점령했었습니다. Even though the army fought an effective defensive war from its last remaining holdout in Moldova, the government was forced, following the Russian collapse, to sign the Treaty of Bucharest in 1918. The southern part of Dobrogea was returned to Bulgaria, the Carpathian passes were ceded to Austria-Hungariy, and the country's economy became dominated by German and Austrian companies, with Romania getting the province of Bessarabia from the fallen Russian Empire in return.\n\nAfter the death of Ferdinand in 1927, the military managed to effectively seize the reigns of government, installing the 6 year old Michael, Ferdinand's grandson, as their puppet king, completely bypassing Carol II, the late king's disgraced son. Of the various groups which collaborated with the military, the right-wing Iron Guard, led by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, proved the most dangerous. They managed to acquire more and more power within the state apparatus, eventually violently ousting the part of the military government still opposing them in 1935 and setting Codreanu up as the new Conducător, while the young king fled the country.\n\nCodreanu now rules over a divided nation, promising to restore Romania to its former greatness, throw off the shackles of its oppression and be rid of its enemies both foreign and domestic."

Since he lacks a real power base, he would be a loyal ally, but still give some legitimacy to the new regime due to his royal heritage.\n\nThe other option is to invite the former Regent of Romania, Prince Nicholas to form a government. He is the younger brother of the former Crown Prince Carol, who has refused to rule as a puppet king.
