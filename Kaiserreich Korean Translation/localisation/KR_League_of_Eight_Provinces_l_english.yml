LEP_Conspicuous_Kleptocracy:0 "두드러진 도둑 정치"
LEP_Conspicuous_Kleptocracy_desc:0 "지난 10년 이후, 쑨촨팡은 독점적인 독일의 경제 개발을 위하여 중국 동부와 남부의 광대한 구역을 개방하였습니다. 이미 부패한 거의 모든 군인과 관리들은 무기 밀반입부터 도난품 거래까지 모든 일에 연루되어 있습니다. 이것은 연합 전체에 좋지 않은 영향을 미치고 있습니다."

LEP_Provincial_Armies_desc:0 "연합은 규모가 크지만, 군대의 대부분은 사실상 지도자들의 쑨 원수에 대한 개인적 충성심으로 연합된 반독립적인 지방군의 집합체입니다. 이는 모병을 쉽게 만들어주지만, 보급 및 조직력에서 심각한 핸디캡이 존재합니다."
LEP_Nanking_Kommission:0 "난징위원회"
LEP_Nanking_Kommission_desc:0 "베를린을 대표하여 연합의 지도에 대하여 조언하는 난징위원회에는 독일군을 따라 중국군 사단을 개편시키기 위한 장교단도 포함되어 있습니다. 지금까지 그들은 원수의 개인 사단을 무장시키고 훈련시키는 데 성공하였으며, 세계대전의 교훈을 장교들에게 전달하였습니다."

LEP_qi_rules_nanjing:0 "치셰위안이 난징을 장악하다"
LEP_qi_rules_nanjing_desc:0 "존경받는 원수이자 난징 주변의 많은 부대들의 지휘관인 치셰위안이 도시를 장악하였습니다. 이로써 그는 쑨의 명목상의 후계자가 되었습니다. 치셰위안이 현재 난징 군벌을 다스리고 있습니다. 그러나, 이전의 팔성연합 때부터 존재하던 혼돈이 군림하고 있고, 팔성연합의 지방 지도자들이 치셰위안을 인정할지는 확실하지 않습니다."
LEP_north_south_west:0 "북부, 남부 혹은 서부"
LEP_north_south_west_desc:0 "난징 군벌은 북부, 남부, 그리고 서부에 적들을 가지고 있습니다. 우리 영토는 분단되어 있고, 안칭 군벌은 우리의 심장부 가까이에 있습니다. 우리는 먼저 어떤 적에게 초점을 맞출 것인지를 선택해야 합니다. 우리는 또한 그들의 충성심을 확실히 하기 위하여 팔성연합 지방 지도자들과 다시 접촉해볼 필요가 있습니다."
LEP_jiangnan_loans:0 "장난 대출금"
LEP_jiangnan_loans_desc:0 "AOG는 검은 월요일에 큰 타격을 입었으며, 우리가 양보해준 많은 것들에 대한 임대료를 지불할 수 없었습니다. 이것은 용납할 수 없는 일이지만, 지금 당장은 그들의 지지에 의존하는 이상 우리가 할 수 있는 일이 없습니다. 장난 협력단은 위기와는 동떨어져 있었기에 우리에게 대출을 해 주었는데, 우리 군대와 정부를 위한 자금을 마련하기 위해서는 받아야만 할 것입니다."
LEP_aog_gun_shipments:0 "AOG 총기 수송"
LEP_aog_gun_shipments_desc:0 "AOG는 아직 재정을 관리하지 못하고 있지만, 어느 정도 안정화되기 시작하였습니다. 그들은 많은 양의 총기를 가지고 있습니다. 그리고 우리는 이것들을 받아가야만 합니다. 우리는 심각하도록 총기가 부족한 상태이기 때문입니다. 자체적인 생산능력 또한 제한되어 있어 지원의 가치는 더욱 높습니다."
LEP_consolidate_the_heartland:0 "심장부 통합"
LEP_consolidate_the_heartland_desc:0 "이제 우리의 상황도 안정되기 시작하였으므로, 난징과 주변 지방을 중심으로 우리의 심장부를 공고히 하기 위한 큰 노력을 기울이는 것이 무엇보다 중요할 것입니다. 이것은 우리가 공격할 수 있는 강력한 핵심 영토를 확보할 수 있습니다. 하지만, 만약 우리가 다른 문제들을 다루기 전에 이것부터 손을 댄다면, 그렇게 효과적이지는 않을지도 모릅니다. 통합에 초점을 맞추려면 적절한 시기를 찾아야만 합니다."
LEP_qis_central_command:0 "치셰위안의 중앙 사령부"
LEP_qis_central_command_desc:0 "우리가 의존하고 있는 현 지방 지도자들의 군대의 체계적이지 못하고 분권화된 성격은 현재의 분쟁에 충분하지 않습니다. 우리는 통일된 중앙 사령부를 세워야만 합니다. 지방 지도자들은 현 권한을 유지하겠지만, 이제 중요한 결정은 분리하는 대신 조정으로 이루어지게 될 것입니다."
LEP_enforce_officer_loyalty:0 "장교들에게 충성심 강요"
LEP_enforce_officer_loyalty_desc:0 "우리 장교들의 충성심은 의심스럽습니다. 우리는 몇 년 동안 치셰위안을 따라온 핵심 세력을 가지고 있지만, 이제 지방 지도자들의 군대뿐만이 아니라 이전의 쑨의 세력 또한 상당 부분 장악하고 있으니 확신할 수는 없습니다. 국민당과 일관도 또한 비밀리에 계속 사람을 모집하고 있으니, 우리는 장교들이 난징 군벌의 대의에 충성을 다하도록 만들어야만 하고, 다른 세력은 없어야만 합니다."
LEP_emergency_industry_reallocation:0 "긴급 산업 재할당"
LEP_emergency_industry_reallocation_desc:0 "우리의 제한된 산업들 중 상당수가 혼란에 빠져 있습니다. 우리는 군수품 생산에 초점을 맞추기 위하여 우리가 이용할 수 있는 산업을 조정할 필요가 있습니다. 우리 스스로는 자원이 없기 때문에, 이를 위해서는 장난 협력단과 AOG에 의존해야만 합니다. 우리는 무능한 장교들이 문제를 일으키지 않도록 일부 자산을 그들의 관리하에 둘 것입니다."
LEP_price_controls:0 "가격 통제"
LEP_price_controls_desc:0 "팔성연합이 붕괴되면서 우리의 화폐는 거의 가치가 없어졌고 인플레이션이 빠른 속도로 상승하고 있습니다. 가격 통제가 이상적인 해결책은 아니지만, 우리는 병사들에게 봉급을 제대로 지급하기 위하여 최소한 일시적으로 평가 절하를 중단해야만 합니다. 이는 또한 지방을 진정시키며 적어도 당분간은 식품 가격의 상승을 멈출 것입니다."
LEP_suppress_student_unions:0 "학생회 억제"
LEP_suppress_student_unions_desc:0 "이른바 '애국' 학생회라 알려진 이 단체는 한동안 우리에게 가시거리가 되어 왔습니다. 그들은 반대 시위의 핵심 세력이었으며 도시에서 계속해 말썽을 일으키고 있습니다. 만약 우리가 그들의 조직 수단을 폐쇄한다면, 우리는 그 운동을 전체적으로 억제할 수 있기를 바래볼 수 있을 것입니다."
LEP_enforce_media_controls:0 "강압적인 대중매체 통제"
LEP_enforce_media_controls_desc:0 "언론은 연합의 붕괴에 공모하여 우리 정부에 대한 부정적인 보도를 계속하고 있으며 치셰위안의 이름을 계속 비방하고 있습니다. 우리는 우리의 목표를 위태롭게 할 수 있는 위험한 정보의 확산을 막기 위하여 많은 대중매체들을 통제해야만 합니다."
LEP_government_by_coercion:0 "강압적인 정부"
LEP_government_by_coercion_desc:0 "이제 우리가 연합을 지배하고 있으며, 어떤 일이 있어도 연합이 다시 무너지는 것만은 막아야 합니다. 우리는 쑨촨팡이 저지른 실수를 저지르지 않을 것입니다. 그 대신 나약함이 아닌 강력한 힘에 기반한 정부를 만들 것입니다. 우리는 연합의 생존을 위해서 가혹한 방법을 피하지 않을 것입니다."
LEP_finish_sun_investigation:0 "쑨 수사 종결"
LEP_finish_sun_investigation_desc:0 "우리는 전 연합의 지도자 쑨촨팡의 암살사건에 대한 조사 결과를 제시하기 위하여 충분히 오랫동안 기다려왔습니다. 이제 일을 끝내고 그 결과를 대중에게 공개할 때입니다. 우리는 이러한 결과가 우리의 입지를 강화시키는 방법이 되기를 바래봐야 합니다."
LEP_undermine_sun_loyalists:0 "연루자 숙청"
LEP_undermine_sun_loyalists_desc:0 "현재 우리 정부의 많은 사람들이 여전히 우리를 지지할 것이라고 확신할 수 없습니다. 우리의 쑨 암살사건 수사 결과 발표와 함께 우리의 적들을 붕괴의 공모자로 묘사함으로써, 그들을 상당수 체포하여 존재 자체를 제거 할 수 있을 것입니다."
LEP_university_oversight_board:0 "대학 감독 위원회"
LEP_university_oversight_board_desc:0 "우리는 학생들이 조직화되면 얼마나 위험해질 수 있는지를 보았습니다. 그들은 반대 운동의 주역들이었고 우리가 제대로 감시하지 않으면 계속 위험할 것입니다. 따라서 우리는 대학 내 모든 '위험한' 개인을 중화시키는 '대학 감독 위원회'를 설립해야 합니다."
lep_governor_1:0 "이제 우리는 다시 저장과 안후이를 지배하고 있습니다. 이 두 곳의 지방 지도자들은 모두 반역적으로 우리에게 대항하여 일어섰고, 우리는 그들을 대신할 사람을 결정해야 합니다. 우리는 그들이 우리의 가까운 동맹인지 확실하게 확인해야만 하며 그들이 전임자들의 실수를 되풀이하지 않도록 하여야 합니다. 나아가 치셰위안에게 반대하는 다른 지방 지도자들과의 형식적인 관계도 끝내야만 합니다."
lep_governor_2:0 "안후이의 지방 지도자 Chen Tiaoyuan의 반역적 봉기가 있던 후, 우리는 이제 다시 한번 그의 지방을 지배하고 있습니다. 우리는 Chen을 대신할 사람을 안후이의 지방 지도자로 정해야 하며, 우리의 후임자가 Chen의 실수를 되풀이하지 않도록 하여야 합니다. 나아가 치셰위안에게 반대하는 다른 지방 지도자들과의 형식적인 관계도 끝내야만 합니다."

LEP_track_down_kmt_desc:0 "푸젠에서는 국민당의 부대를 몰아냈을지도 모르지만, 우리 영토 내에서는 계속 게릴라들과의 전투가 벌어지고 있습니다. 우리는 또한 일부 국민당의 당원들이 우리 정부에 침투하였을지도 모른다며 우려하고 있습니다. 남은 국민당의 기지를 추적하여 국민당의 잔당들을 제거해야만 합니다."
LEP_crack_down_yiguandao_sects:0 "일관도 엄중 단속"
LEP_crack_down_yiguandao_sects_desc:0 "일관도의 신봉자들은 계속해서 우리 시민들을 공포에 떨게 하고 있습니다. 우리가 산칭에서 멀리 떨어졌을지도 모르지만, 많은 신봉자들이 여전히 문제를 일으키고 있습니다. 우리는 그들의 운동을 무력화시키기 위해 일관도에 대한 대대적인 단속을 시작해야만 합니다."
LEP_reconstitute_baojia_system:0 "보갑제도 복원"
LEP_reconstitute_baojia_system_desc:0 "보갑제도는 한 지역을 지역의 민병대가 통제하는 계획입니다. 안정성을 높이고 지역 책임 배정을 목표로 한 것입니다. 과거에는 이 제도가 실패하였었지만 이제는 우리가 효과적으로 농촌을 순찰할 수 있고 지방 지도자들을 피해갈 수 있기 때문에 매우 유용할 것입니다."
LEP_xiangyong_inspections:0 "향용 사찰"

By sidestepping both international agreements and Beijing's authority, German strength helps hold together the League and maintain autonomy from Wu Peifu's Northern Zhili, in exchange for an ever increasing spread of German influence.\n\nThis arrangement has gradually lost its lusture.

Most do not believe this assassin was working alone, and people want answers. Some have suggested she was a Kuomintang agent, others believe she was part of the Yiguandao. Some think she was an agent of Chen, others argue she simply wanted revenge. Some even suggest that it was Qi himself who ordered the killing! An investigation must be started to find the answer. \n\nWith this investigation, there must of course be an investigator.

We could choose a man who was close and loyal to Sun, who will know him best and know where to look. However, he may not show Qi in the best light, as many loyal to Sun believe Qi was willing to push Sun aside a little too enthusiastically, and have suspicions of him. Another option is to choose someone loyal to Qi, whom will make sure the results will not harm out administration, but some will not trust the results.

How is our military supposed to function when the officers serving do not hold absolute loyalty to Qi Xieyuan and Nanjing? To solve this, over the last few days, a massive purge has occurred across our whole officer staff. A committee titled the Military Loyalty Committee was formed, filled with investigators who review all of our officers histories and past ties, and questioned many who were in Nanjing. The Military Loyalty Committee ordered the arrest of many officers, who were found to have links to the Kuomintang, Yiguandao, or some military warlord. All of the treacherous officers have either been imprisoned indefinitely, or have already been taken care of."

It is clear that the newspapers were complicit in the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, and though we are faced by many enemies, they continue to write lies and slander against League-Marshal Qi, ironically even blaming him for the Leagues collapse. However, it cannot be ignored how much potential these newspapers have for propaganda.

Many people throughout the population, from the peasant class all the way to the highest offices were complicit in the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces. Therefore, the only answer is to purge the complicit. In doing this we must focus on one of the main groups currently opposing us. The young students of China is where dissent and rebellion spreads. The Kuomintang and the Yiguandao remain in secrecy, and must still be destroyed. Even Sun Chuanfang's old friends and associates have shown they are not to be trusted."

After finding this information, a small force of military police and infantry units was organised in Longyan, led by Li Shengchun, which then moved south to the location given. There, in the mountains a few miles from Longyan, scouts found the massive Kuomintang base. After surrounding the compound, Li moved in all units, and were faced with little resistance. After arresting and interrogating multiple KMT members at the base, it became clear that all the soldiers and military leaders had already escaped, apparently planning on going into hiding again in the North of Vietnam. After all the KMT members were arrested or killed, any documents inside were seized and the base was burned to the ground. With this main headquarters of the Kuomintang now in ashes, the Kuomintang itself has been pushed back years in organisation."

Therefore, military police have been sent into all the major Yiguandao monasteries, who have arrested the heads of these monasteries.

Talks went on for hours, in a quiet hall in a small street in Wuxi. Only minimal guards were present, and most high level officials didn't even know of the meeting. At the end of the talks, the result is a plan they unofficially titled \"The Du Nanjing Scheme\". Trhough this plan, Du will use his high level and shady business connections to funnel more capital through Nanjing, and will help keep Qi supplied with weapons through backroom dealings. To pay for this, Nanjing will pay Du directly, with the agreement that 40% of this money will be used in pushing pro-Chinese business in the Legation Cities. Hands were shaken, witnesses were dealt with, and payments were made."

Though the Nanjing police would normally step in to try to curb illegal gang growth, it seems the Nanjing police commissioner has stopped this from occuring, stating the polce should focus on beating \"enemies of the state\". Many assume that he was payed off by the Green Gang. However, the truth of the matter is that the Green Gang themselves never bribed the police commissioner.

Later on that day, another 2 bodies were found dumped on the street in the slums of Nanjing. These other deaths have been identified as more high level anti-Qi activists. They were also beaten to death, and rope marks on their hands and the extent of the beating implies that they were tortured before death. 8 men were arrested in suspicion of committing the crimes, all members of the Green Gang in Nanjing. However, they only sat in a cell for 5 hours, as Qi quickly informed the Nanjing police commissioner that the prisoners should be released immediately, as they are not connected to the murders at all. Qi himself announced that he would form a team to investigate these deaths, however, progress on this is very unlikely. With these activists' deaths, the anti-Qi protests in Nanjing have dispursed, and the city is safe once again."

It was bound to boil over eventually, as it has today. A man, dressed as a regular peasant, was walking past a group of soldiers, when suddenly he drew a pistol and began to shoot at them. Though that man was killed quickly by the troops, it was in fact a distraction, as while the man was being killed, a large group of Kuomintang troops charged at the soldiers from the other side, and shot them all. As the day went on, more loyal soldiers joined the fighting, but were countered by more Kuomintang attacks. Dozens, maybe hundreds were killed, but thankfully, by the evening, the fighting had dwindled, and order was secured."

It took multiple pushes from hundreds of our own troops to be able to get back into the square and clear it of their guerillas, who quickly retreated back into the back streets, eventually harboured in the homes of many of the peasants living there. However, the officer leading the attack decided that these KMT must be rooted out of [getlepattacklocationcitykmt], and so sent out around 200 soldiers on a killing spree throughout the city. Hundreds of civilians were lined up and shot, and the houses of many were burned to the ground.

Armed mercenaries stood guard around the building while the bankers arrived. Preliminary discussions were nice and calm, however the attitude changed when the group got to business.\n\nLeague-Marshal Qi made his stance clear: for the Jiangzhe Caifa to continue to do as much business as they do throughout the League, they must offer Nanjing resources and loans to be used \"to protect their business interests for them\". Of course, the bankers did not react well to this, claiming that they could protect their own financial institutions, and anyway, their profits from the League were minor compared to the profits they've found in the Legation Cities. Qi was ready for this line though, as he stated clearly that should they not give these resources to Nanjing \"the Green Gang will make sure you never do business in Shanghai ever again.\"Several of the men were shocked at what they heard. Perhaps Qi had made a mistake. It was an open fact that many of these bankers were also paying off the Green Gang, and most likely have better relations with their leaders than Qi, who's only met Du Yuesheng once.\n\nAs the bankers began to discuss the resources to be sent to Nanjing, though, a wave of relief flowed through Qi.

It was no surprise, then, when Chen rose up against the League, and brought it to the edge of ruin. It is clear that, due to his anti-German policies, his province of Anhui is in severe need of investment and development. Therefore, the question of who shall become the next governor of Anhui is paramount.\n\nReally, there are two main options. The first is Xie Hongxun, a relatively minor military officer and bureaucrat in Nanjing. However, his main appeal as governor is the relatively close relationship he had to Sun Chuanfang. Many still see Qi as a usurper, so placing a Sun loyalist to such a high level position would be a popular move, and he is weak enough that he will be easy to control.\n\nHowever, there is a second option. With the problem all starting from Anhui's breakaway, perhaps it is time to centralise the League slightly more. League-Marshal Qi Xieyuan is always an option, so that Anhui can be kept on a closer leash to Nanjing, though it might not be that popular with the population at large."

Though he is relatively minor, his organisational skill is notable, and the skills he got from working in Beijing will help him develop the province.\n\nThird is Xia Chao, a minor commander with no real notable victories to his name.

It was this friendship that got Zhou to his position, not any sign of impressive skill or ability. Though Fujian has developed decently under Zhou, it still remains the most impoverished province in the League. We must make the choice of whether to keep Zhou, or whether to put in someone new.\n\nThe other option for governor of Fujian is Kong Zhaotong, a relatively minor military leader from Fujian. However, Kong's main appeal is his close relationship to Qi Xieyuan, wiht Kong acting as one of Qi's commanders directly in Fujian. Kong showed decent ability while fighting the Kuomintang, and his anti-socialst credentials are up to standard. His close links to Qi means he must be far more competent than the Sun loyalist Zhou.

The opening is noteworthy for a few reasons, first among them the prominent involvement of Chinese engineers in the construction despite its significant funding by the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatische Generalverwaltung, also known as the AOG, which has turned the work into something of a cause celebre.\n\nThose less optimistic have been quick to point out the AOG's newfound access to rich mineral deposits, as well as Jingdezhen Porcelain, which has been able to fetch high prices in Berlin.\n\nDespite concerns, a threatened attack upon the opening ceremony by Kuomintang agents did not take place."

lepcollapse.3.t:0 "An Unexpected Announcement"
lepcollapse.3.d:0 "Late this morning, to the surprise of many, the AOG publicly announced its plans to purchase and consolidate a number of eastern railways on behalf of the Schantung-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, one of its component concerns. Among them is the new Zhegan Railway.\n\nThe AOG already possesses controlling shares in a number of lines across Eastern China, several of which it directly financed, but this dashes the hopes of those who believed the new railway might represent a more equal future for Germans and Chinese. While Chinese management will be permitted to remain, they will now answer to a German directory board. Though scarcely admitted to the public, few authorities in the League seem to have been forewarned of this development, and the police response to protests has been slower than normal."

lepcollapse.4.t:0 "Unrest Spreads"
lepcollapse.4.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the consolidation of the Central China Railway under AOG management has met with widespread criticism. Intellectuals have condemned the move in domestic papers, followed by prominent Anglo-American publications out of Shanghai, and echoed by Syndicalist party periodicals found on factory floors. More troubling however, the news has spread rapidly by word of mouth, and has grown all the more outrageous and fantastical in the process.\n\nTales now describe extensive webs of conspiracy, disappearances of outspoken individuals, and the supposed transfer of millions of Yuan into the League-Marshal's own pockets. The publics reaction has been predictably furious, and protests have already spread from Zhejiang and Jiangxi to the major coastal cities, including the foreign settlements."

lepcollapse.5.d:0 "Beginning with assaults on prominent German Citizens, and having grown to become virtually indiscriminate, attacks on foreigners by emboldened "patriotic" citizens are spreading like wildfire. The German consulate in Nanjing has advised the Kaiser's subjects to arm themselves, and travel only when necessary. The consulates of most other nationalities may soon follow suit.\n\nThe impact of these attacks on business and investment remains to be seen, but recent history suggests the Shanghai Stock Exchange will not remain unaffected."

lepcollapse.6.d:0 "Talk of a boycott on German goods has accompanied growing protests throughout Eastern China, provoked by an assortment of Kuomintang agents, religious cultists, and nationalist ideologues. More disturbingly some local garrisons have stepped back and allowed the unrest to grow, unwilling to risk being labelled 'Hanjian' or 'race traitors'. In order to ward off intervention from Beijing, advisers from the Nanking-Kommission have suggested that League-Marshal Sun publicly declare that the situation is under control.\n\nElements of several divisions based in Nanjing stand ready to be deployed to cities along the lower Yangtze, where protests are largest, and provincial garrisons could be given the green light to take whatever action they deem necessary to quell the open dissent."

The deaths and delays have brought transportation to a standstill in many areas, and has slowed the deployment of additional forces to quell the growing unrest.\n\nBlame for the attacks has been levelled against various targets, from bandits, to the KMT, to Japanese agents. Some especially conspiracy-minded individuals have suggested German involvement, who they suggest are targeting their own possessions to set the stage for an intervention."

lepcollapse.8.d:0 "Troubling reports have reached Nanjing from both Xuzhou and Quanzhou.\n\nIn the Jiangfu Insurgent Zone, KMT guerillas have staged a series of increasingly bold raids, striking around the inland cities of Yongding and Longyan. Governor Zhou Yinren has long struggled to assert control over his mountainous province, with control often limited to the coast and the larger inland cities, and now his grasp grows all the more tenuous.\n\nMeanwhile in Jiangsu, governor Zheng Junyan reports increased agitation by Yiguandao adherents, spreading over the border from Shandong. These religious fanatics have been a point of long-standing frustration for the Governor, but their involvement may well be encouraging the rising unrest."

lepcollapse.9.t:0 "A Telegram from Beijing"
lepcollapse.9.d:0 "A telegram has been received from Beijing, apparently sent at the direction of Imperial Commissioner Wu Peifu, who sits as Qing Army Minister and the undisputed head of the nation's central military apparatus. The message inquires about the current chaotic state of affairs, clearly worded with the intent to force League-Marshal Sun to admit some weakness or hardship.\n\nThe Central Government, under Wu's direction, has repeatedly attempted to extend its direct authority south, but so far such efforts have been in vain. Our response must be careful and measured, demonstrating that we need no Central Government assistance to disperse these insurrectionists."

The garrison, itself reinforced by a section of German-trained troops from Nanjing, attempted to restore order, but in the confused melee someone started shooting. Within a matter of minutes police, the garrison, and their reinforcing troops had begun firing on the crowd and each other. Over two hundred are already confirmed dead, with four times as many likely wounded, and the resultant outrage has already sparked protests in surrounding areas.\n\nThe situation is made all the worse by the presence of a small foreign settlement within the city. Many are already claiming that lethal force was only used in order to protect these foreigners, and the killings will most likely feature in international newspapers by tomorrow morning."

lepcollapse.11.d:0 "Citing the recent incident at Wuhu, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan has issued an ultimatum calling for the withdrawal of all non-provincial forces from Anhui, as well as the immediate hand-over of those officers responsible. Though Chen assures the league that his own soldiers will continue to quell the spreading unrest and disorder, he refuses further cooperation with League authorities and denounces the creation of the Central China Railway, which he blames for \"pushing patriotic citizens to the edge of despair\".\n\nUnder normal circumstances this behavior would be unacceptable, but Chen's stance has already proven popular and decisive action could serve to further divide the now fragile League."

lepcollapse.12.d:0 "Although it began a world away, Black Monday's fallout has already reached China. The Shanghai Exchange plummeted before closing at numbers unseen since the financial tumult of 1925, and local institutions are already doing what they can to mitigate the damage. Fortunately, the average citizen is unlikely to feel any immediate impact, but the AOG, already staggering under an extensive retaliatory boycott, faces dire financial circumstances.\n\nIts clerks have already issued notice that it may be unable to pay the usual rents for its various concessions, and that the final payment promised for the Zhegan Railway has been \"indefinitely postponed\". Without this planned revenue, we will be forced to enact major budget cuts."

lepcollapse.13.t:0 "Dissension in the Ranks"
lepcollapse.13.d:0 "Word of suspended pay has already spread as far as the League's junior officers, and the reaction has been predictably negative. For some this will mean an end to lifestyles of vice and extravagance, at least for the time-being, but for many a common soldier it's the difference between life and starvation.\n\nThe officers' grumbling is made all the worse by a small but vocal clique of officers sympathetic to Chen Tiaoyuan's cause, arguing that the League should never have become so dependent on German 'handouts'. In the barracks and in the streets, soldiers are being riled up by Yiguandao adherents, seeking converts and preaching against foreign 'wickedness', while the Kuomintang and other leftist groups hide in the shadows, disseminating propaganda and denouncing 'imperialist collaboration'. Nothing has yet come of these activities, but what was once routine unrest is now threatening undermine the very foundations of the League."

With no promise of pay, soldiers in Xuzhou, Nanchang, Quanzhou, and several other cities are either refusing to act or outright joining the spreading violence and looting, while police and garrisons in Hangzhou and Wuxi have gone on strike. Riots there and elsewhere are gradually escaping all semblance of control, made all the worse by Sun Chuanfang's incapacity.\n\nTroublingly, telegraph lines south of Fujian appear to have been cut, leaving us entirely in the dark as to the likely worsening situation in Guangzhou and Guangxi, while Nanjing itself is now practically in the throes of violent revolution."

lepaog.11.d:0 "The first order of business is deciding on the extent of the loans we are taking out. While a larger loan may be more cost-effective, we may only need a small financial investment to reinvigorate our economy. "
lepaog.11.a:0 "Go big or go home."
lepaog.11.b:0 "A reasonably sized loan is needed."
lepaog.11.c:0 "We only need a small financial boost."

lepaog.12.t:0 "DAB Loans: Destination"
lepaog.12.d:0 "Not all of our industry is suffering to the same extent. To maximise the effect of the loans, we need to decide what industry should benefit from the DAB loans."
lepaog.12.a:0 "Prioritize Production"
lepaog.12.b:0 "Prioritize Construction"
lepaog.12.c:0 "Prioritize Military Industry"

lepaog.13.t:0 "AOG Demands Early Repayment!"
lepaog.13.d:0 "In shocking, but perhaps not unexpected surprise, the AOG has requested that we repay our DAB loans early, due to increasing financial tensions in the region. While this is both frustrating and a detriment to our economy, there is nothing we can do but agree to the new terms."
lepaog.13.a:0 "Really?!"

lepaog.14.t:0 "AOG Banking Expands"
lepaog.14.d:0 "The German century continues for the AOG, it'd seem, as the DAB has used the aftermath of Black Monday to further expand its financial monopoly in China. While this may be a long-term concern, right now it is a direct benefit to our own economy."
lepaog.14.a:0 "Good for them."

lepaog.15.t:0 "DAB Buys out League Banks"
lepaog.15.d:0 "In a rather awkward turn of events, the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank has begun to buy out failing League banks across the country. While there is nothing we can do to challenge this, it continues to undermine our authority when it comes to our own economy."
lepaog.15.a:0 "Fine by us."
lepaog.15.b:0 "We'd prefer that they remain in Chinese hands."

lepaog.16.t:0 "Opening the Interior: Begin"
lepaog.16.d:0 "It is time to make German access to the League interior official. While small independent ventures have already made their way to the region, a fullscale German investment still requires our sign off, and the settling of several key logistical and political questions before it can begin in earnest."
lepaog.16.a:0 "This can't go wrong."

lepaog.17.t:0 "Opening the Interior: Status of the Chinese"
lepaog.17.d:0 "The first order of business is the fate of Chinese businesses in the interior. Several key business leaders are requesting assurances of protection in the case that German investments destorying their livelihoods, while others are outright demanding right-of-privilege over german businesses."
lepaog.17.a:0 "Our own businesses will always take priority."
lepaog.17.b:0 "We can surely find a balance here."
lepaog.17.c:0 "They must learn to coexist with the German presence."

lepaog.18.t:0 "Opening the Interior: Status of the Germans"
lepaog.18.d:0 "The second question pertains to the status of German citizens in the region. While Germans already possess considerable advantages over other foreign nationals, such as embassy rights and passport expiditing, the Nanking-Kommission has 'suggested' that we formally elevate the status of German citizens, as a show of goodwill to our new trading partners."
lepaog.18.a:0 "Issue new laws for German citizens."
lepaog.18.b:0 "Germans and Chinese shall be equal under League laws."
lepaog.18.c:0 "They shall be treated as privileged guests."

lepaog.19.t:0 "Opening the Interior: German Arrival"
lepaog.19.d:0 "With outstanding matters concluded, German entry into the interior has begun in earnest. While the full fruits of this decision may take a while to be felt, we are already receiving a benefit from the modest economic boom happening in our country."
lepaog.19.a:0 "Let's hope they enjoy their stay."

lepaog.20.t:0 "Opening the Interior: Business Conflicts!"
lepaog.20.d:0 "It seems that nothing ever goes off without a hitch. Several Chinese businesses have filed complaints, alleging German exploitation, monopolisation, and financial bullying in regions where German investment has grown thickest. In response the AOG has sent a counter-claim, aruging that Chinese officials and businesses are not sufficiently cooperating and on occassion downright frustrating the actions of German business interests in the region."
lepaog.20.a:0 "Our Businesses should take priority."
lepaog.20.b:0 "The Germans should take priority."
lepaog.20.c:0 "Who's to say?"

lepaog.21.t:0 "Opening the Interior: Finish"
lepaog.21.d:0 "With the first rush of investment having finally settled down, our interior has entered a state of new 'normal.' While the full ramifications of our decision will only be felt over the coming decades, we can already see the beginnings of such changes taking route in our economy."
lepaog.21.a:0 "Glad that's over with."

lepaog.22.t:0 "Schantung-Eisenbahn Expansion"
lepaog.22.d:0 "While the Schantung Eisenbahngesellschaft is not directly controlled by the AOG, they are still effectively a German proxy. There is debate amongst our government whether, as such, they should be trusted with complete control of the rails, or whether some level of Chinese control is required."
lepaog.22.a:0 "We must respect the German buyout."
lepaog.22.b:0 "We Demand equal ownership!"

lepaog.23.t:0 "Railroad Payments"
lepaog.23.d:0 "Railroads aren't cheap. While the work of the SEG has proven quite profitable, it hasn't been delivered gratis. The Nanking-Kommission has politely reminded us that a reasonable repayment is expected, and soon."
lepaog.23.a:0 "Repay them."
lepaog.23.b:0 "Repay them with influence."
lepaog.23.c:0 "What payments?"

lepaog.24.t:0 "The Schantung-Eisenbahn Expands"
lepaog.24.d:0 "Following our economic support of the project, the SEG continues to make tracks inwards into the League. While there is a general disquiet about such proceedings, nobody can deny that the Germans are good at making the trains run on time."
lepaog.24.a:0 "Excellent."

lepaog.25.t:0 "Rail Taxes?"
lepaog.25.d:0 "An idea has been floated in the central government about a new rail tax on the general populace to pay for our continued expansion. While unpopular, it may be necessary to find a new temporary source of income to help continue our industrialisation."
lepaog.25.a:0 "A smart idea."
lepaog.25.b:0 "Raising taxes pleases no one."

lepaog.26.t:0 "Germans Ask for Tax Exemption"
lepaog.26.d:0 "In a display of arrogance, the AOG has request that all German businesses be exempt from our new rail tax. The fact that we raised this tax to pay for their railroads hasn't seemed to register, and they are quite insistent on this demand, what should we do?"
lepaog.26.a:0 "Fine."
lepaog.26.b:0 "Yea, no."

lepaog.27.t:0 "Eastern Resources Commission: Introduction"
lepaog.27.d:0 "The Eastern Resources commission, primarily drawn from Chinese business interests and AOG monopolists, have managed to put aside their many differences in the pursuit of a shared goal: profit. While Chinese interests provide the location and manpower for resource extraction, the Germans provide the technical know-how and equipment to proper extract such resources."
lepaog.27.a:0 "Let's hope they find something worthwhile."

lepaog.28.t:0 "Status of Germans on the Commission"
lepaog.28.d:0 "Apparently dissatisfied with the current status quo, the AOG has demmanded a reshuffle of the Eastern Resources Commission, arguing that German interests 'are not adequately' represented by the commission. By this, they presumably mean that they do not have full control of the board, and want to rectify this. While it is a blazen grab for power, without AOG backing, the commission itself is almost functionally useless."
lepaog.28.a:0 "Allow a German majority."
lepaog.28.b:0 "Acquiese, but try to curtail their influence."

lepaog.29.t:0 "AOG Requests Renegotiation of German Rights"
lepaog.29.d:0 "With the continued success of the Eastern Resources Commission, the AOG has once again called for an elevation of German interests in the region. While German citizens and businesses already receive ample privileges, the AOG has asked that we elevate these rights in perpuity, to 'solidify the successful Sino-German Relationship.'"
lepaog.29.a:0 "A reasonable request."
lepaog.29.b:0 "The situation as it stands is fine."

lepaog.30.t:0 "German Industrial Expansion"
lepaog.30.d:0 "Just as before, our business with the Germans has proven fabulously profitable. With new resource deposits being opened and their wealth within flowing (mostly) into our collars, we once again have our friends in Tsingtau to thank."
lepaog.30.a:0 "Business is booming."

lepaog.31.t:0 "AOG Implements Exclusive Economic Zones"
lepaog.31.d:0 "Seizing upon their disproportionate influence in our country, the AOG has implemented a policy of economic exclusivity for German Interests, effectively cinching their monopoly on League investment. While mostly a simple acknowledgement of the present reality, it is concerning that the AOG holds such formidable power inside our own government."
lepaog.31.a:0 "This is for the Good of China."

lepaog.32.t:0 "AOG Implements Free Trade Policy"
lepaog.32.d:0 "Once again flexing their political muscle, the AOG has overruled our officials and instituted a free trade policy for German goods. While this might not be too damaging, it is dangerous to our own internal stability that we are so beholden to the AOG's whims."
lepaog.32.a:0 "This is for the good of China, we swear..."

lepaog.33.t:0 "German Economic Takeover"
lepaog.33.d:0 "In a final economic coup-de-tat, the AOG has successfully Germanized our economy. German banks, factories, and shops throng the streets, and the Mark is more used than the Yuan. Our economy is now effectively that of a German client state."
lepaog.33.a:0 "Oh dear."


lepaog.50.t:0 "League-Ostasien Relations"
lepaog.50.d:0 "The Ostasien administration is the chief backer of the AOG in Asia, and AOG interests are heavily tied to theirs. In a show of collaboration, the AOG has asked that we extend formal diplomatic overtures to the administration, to cement our shared economic interests."
lepaog.50.a:0 "Better friends than enemies."

lepaog.51.t:0 "AOG Requests Our Support!"
lepaog.51.d:0 "With Indochina in open revolt, the AOG has requested that we support Ostasien in quelling the rebellion, both to help a friend in a time of need, and to safeguard against a possible syndicalist threat in future years."
lepaog.51.a:0 "They shall have our full support!"
lepaog.51.b:0 "Send some equipment their way."
lepaog.51.c:0 "They're on their own."

lepaog.52.t:0 "Ostasien Border Agreements"
lepaog.52.d:0 "With Ostasia and the League once again bordering each other, the AOG has suggested an semi-open border policy between our nations, as a show of goodwill and further economic collaboration."
lepaog.52.a:0 "There are no borders between friends."
lepaog.52.b:0 "Let's keep things professional."

lepaog.53.t:0 "League-Ostasien Connection Deepens"
lepaog.53.d:0 "As AOG influence grows, so to does our relationship with Ostasia. To wit, a new economic trade agreement has been drafted by AOG businesses to boost trade between us."
lepaog.53.a:0 "Always good to have friends."

lepaog.54.t:0 "AOG Requests Ostasien Docking Rights"
lepaog.54.d:0 "While Ostasia already has sizable dockyards in Tsingtau, the AOG has requested that we allow German ships dock in League cities also, as a simple precaution in the case of chaotic naval actions in the China Sea."
lepaog.54.a:0 "Granted."
lepaog.54.b:0 "Let them keep their ships in Tsingtau."

lepaog.55.t:0 "AOG Requests Ostasien Military Access"
lepaog.55.d:0 "In a rather audacious request, the AOG has asked for us to give military access to Ostasien troops to protect German interests in our country. While this would be a dramatic ceding of sovereignty, the level of AOG influence in our government makes it difficult to refuse."
lepaog.55.a:0 "A reasonable request."
lepaog.55.b:0 "We must keep some level of distance."

lepaog.56.t:0 "AOG Requests a Full Military Guarantee"
lepaog.56.d:0 "With tensions with Japan on the rise, the AOG has demanded that we make a full showing of support to the German colonies in Asia, and that we guarantee a League response in the event of any attack on German territories. This would effectively throw our lot in with the Reichspakt in the event of war, but may be an inevitable conclusion if war reaches our borders."
lepaog.56.a:0 "Their safety is ours."
lepaog.56.b:0 "This has gone too far!"

lepaog.57.t:0 "Transferring of the Concessions"
lepaog.57.d:0 "In a demonstration of power, the AOG has decided to transfer direct control of the concessions out of our hands, and into those of the Ostasien administration. As humiliating as this is, it was an inevitable conclusion to the almost complete German control of our nation."
lepaog.57.a:0 "It was inevitable."

lepaog.58.t:0 "Von Falkhenhausen Returns to Active Duty"
lepaog.58.d:0 "With the fight against the secessionists threatening the safety of the German concession cities, the leader of the concesion defense force, Alexander Von Falkhenhausen, has returned to active duty to help our fight, and has offered his leadership to our troops. The assistance of such a competent general, and the implicit support in our fight, is a great boon to our war effort."
lepaog.58.a:0 "Any help is welcome."

On top of those people were the governors of the different provinces, whom themselves acted with relative autonomy and answered only to League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang. When the League collapsed with Chen Taioyuans uprising, this web broke apart, with many people rebelling or seizing power for themselves locally, and with governors trying to escape to get safety in Nanjing. With the League now back to a relative state of decency, it is high time we work on sending these governors back, and in many cases getting new governors, so that work can continue."
