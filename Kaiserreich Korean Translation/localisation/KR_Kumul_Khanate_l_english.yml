While normally something like this is not of note, since Zhang is not a Muslim, the local Ulama have expressed their deep opposition to the marriage. For unknown reasons however, the girl's father has agreed to the union and a ceremony is planned a few weeks from now.\n\nKumulilik tensions have been running dangerously high since the annexation, and this brazen action is likely to further inflame the populace. Jin Shuren, however, allegedly gave his support to Zhang in the marriage, so it is unlikely to be stopped now."

kumul.9.t:0 "한 소란이 접수되다"

He was apparently attending a dinner party for the upcoming feast when a large group of men ambushed him and his troops. Had it not been for their drunken state, they may have stood a chance, but they stand no longer.\n\nThis is now the least of our troubles however, as the rebels, now tenfold their previous number, have stormed the entire city. Many of our Han immigrants were massacred, with their heads lobbed off and buried in the dirt. While overrunning the outer city, the remaining Han citizens and administrators have garrisoned themselves inside the old city walls, and are now waiting for relief from Jin Shuren’s forces, if they come."

It appears the Kumuliks were less satisfied than Zhang Mu's reports indicated, and his garrison was suprised several nights ago to a mob of muslim agitants. The survivors tell tale of an arranged marriage between Zhang Ma and an ulama's daughter, as well as tax resistance Zhang Ma promised to report to Jin Shuren but never did. It is obvious now that Hami is lost to Jin's men, and the lives of the Han immigrants hang in the balance should Jin fail in a reprisal."

We neither have the men nor arms to defeat the forces in the old city, but they also lack either the strength or will to counterassault us. Our best General, Yulbar Khan, has announced his departure to recruit an army capable of vanquishing any who would oppose us. While many doubt his capability to find such a miracle, there are hushed whispers he may be conspiring with the most brutal of the Ma warlords, Ma Zhongying. Such an action would be unprecedented and draw much ire, but would also give us a much needed fighting chance."

kumul.12.t:0 "시의 적절한 접선자"
kumul.12.d:0 "As Yulbars entered Ma Zhongying’s tent, undoubtedly the largest among the war camp, he became overcome with the stench of Opium. It nearly drove him away, but he could not deviate from his god-appointed task. Bearing the musk, he approached Zhongying's striking figure at the tent's center.\n\n‘The Tiger Prince of Kumul coming to make me his prey?' the Ma warlord chuckled.\n\n‘I am but an old man, seeking the strength of the Butcher of Gansu.’.\n\nFormalities were brief, as each knew the intention of one another. While the visit was orchestrated to seem like a surprise, much correspondence had been exchanged in the previous weeks. Zhongying had an army without a state, and Yulbars a state without an army. Once all the arrangements had been seen through, Zhongying was quick to set off with his men, and Yulbars followed. After all, how could he miss the sight of this seeming herald of death itself?"
kumul.12.a:0 "위태로운 동맹이군…"

kumul.13.t:0 "죽음의 전조"
kumul.13.d:0 "It seems the rumors were right, Yulbars has returned with the famed Ma Zhongying. While his mere presence is a terrifying thought for many, the sudden presence of thousands more troops struck fear into the very heart of the beleaguered garrison in the Old City. \n\nAs night fell, Zhongying made his move. Hundreds of Kumulilik Horsemen charged the fortifications with a fiery spirit, but were gunned down in an instant by machine guns. This however, did not deter the warlord. Throughout the dim hours of the night, wave after wave assaulted the garrison and were progressively repelled, but not without high cost to the defenders. As ammunition ran low, men began abandoning their rifles for the sword and pike, and fought with a similarly primal intensity. \n\nHowever, it seems fortune favors the bold. In the early hours of the morning, Zhongying’s now exhausted forces finally landed a decisive blow to what remained of the Garrison. As a prize to his soldiers, the Old City was razed to the ground, with anything of any meaningful value now in the hands of his men. Even after such brutal combat, Zhongying has promised [?Root.GetLeader] that he will continue his campaign until the last of Jin Shuren’s forces are crushed under his boot."

As the door closed behind the last guard, the sound of a chirping bird echoed throughout the dungeon. There was the signal. With that, Nasīr pulled out some of the bricks on his cell wall, loosened over weeks of work. Behind it was a tunnel, leading to freedom. After crawling through he was met with two shady men, wearing cloaks over their heads. One of them threw another cloak at Nasīr, who hastily put on the disguise. With that, Nasīr was able to walk right out of Dihua, under the nose of [SIK.GetLeader].\n\nNews of Nasīr's escape has already reached Kumul, even though Nasīr will still not get here for another few days.

Nasīr spoke with Yulbars Khan, thanking him for his service and being briefed on all the recent happenings of the war.

Though for now he remains in his dungeon, rumours have echoed through Dihua, speaking of Nasīr Shah soon to attempt an escape. Nasīr making it back to Kumul would give them a massive morale boost, whereas hearing of his death can only dishearten them.

Nasīr was thrown to his knees as Jin waved the crowd to quiet.\n\n''Nasīr Shah, as governor of Xinjiang, I find you guilty of treachery and rebellion. The penalty for this is death. Do you have any last words?''\n\n''With this bullet, Jin, your reign comes to an end.''\n\nWith that, Jin pulled a pistol from his cloak and shot Nasīr in the back of the head.

We have gone from a small administration on only a small city, to controlling a massive area, far more populated than Kumul itself. Not only this, but we must be wary of those who wish to help us. Both Hoja-Niyaz, the Uygher military leader, and Ma Zhongying, the Butcher of Gansu, have offered their help, though it is unclear whether they wish to help for the good of the people or just for their own personal gain. The Han Chinese will also have large influence in our government, with even some whispers that Fan Yaonan, the Han bureaucrat thought to be dead after his actions in the Xinjiang Clique, may still be alive. Though these groups may help, we must be sure to not allow them too much infuence, or else they may try to even bring an end the the Khanate."

However, these reforms were cut short by our successful Kumul Rebellion.

After finding out the location of Sabit Damulla from an interrogation, our military staff has decided that now is the time to act. The person most prepared to run this mission is our general Mahmut Muhiti. He in the past has had links to the Turkic independence movements, but has since given us his loyalty.

As one of the guards sat on a step, taking apart his gun, his skull was suddenly filled with lead. The gunshot rang through the valley, as the rest of the guards sprang into action. A firefight broke out as, from the peak of a nearby hill, a band of soliders, around 18 strong, charged down the hill, led by Kumul general Mahmut Muhiti. The group were able to kill the 7 guards outside the house, but lost 3 themselves. As they approached the house, they lost 2 more to guards shooting out from the window. Muhiti himself kicked through the door and shot another guard through the head with his pistol. The group travelled through the house and killed another 3 guards, losing none themselves. Now, the only one left was Sabit Damulla. As the approached Sabit's bedroom, Muhiti reloaded his pistol, smiling at his success. However, when he bashed through the door, all he found was an empty bed and an open window. Muhiti realised his mistake of not leaving more soldiers outside to guard the perimeter, as Sabit Damulla slipped through his grasp. Within the hour hundreds of Sabits troops got to the house, but by then Muhiti and his men had gone.\n\nThough the assassination was a failure, it will still have dire consequences. Sabit Damulla, paranoid for his life, has gone into hiding, leaving it very difficult to communicate with him. Divisions are left disorganised and are even sometimes turing against eachother."

However, by the time he got to Sabit's bedroom, he had escaped.\n\nThough Muhiti failed in his mission, this is not a total loss.

[TAN.GetLeader] was about to send Ma Zhongying out to deal with these rebellions when news suddenly reached Kumul city: Fan Yaonan is still alive. The Han bureaucrat, after being cast away by the previous administration, went into hiding in a mountain village north of Dihua. When the previous administration was overthrown, he travelled to Kumul city, to pledge allegiance to [TAN.GetLeader], and to offer his help in organising the state.

Hoja-Niyaz is a diplomat, is flexible, and is a major Uygher leader. His popularity with the Uyghers is almost unmatched.
