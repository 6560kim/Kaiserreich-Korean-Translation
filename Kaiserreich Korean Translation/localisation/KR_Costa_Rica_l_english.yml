COS_Combat_Social_Inequality:0 "사회적 불평등과 싸우자"
COS_Combat_Social_Inequality_desc:0 "비록 대서양노동자의회가 플랜테이션 노동자들의 권리를 위해 열심히 싸웠음에도 불구하고 부유한 독일인 커피 남작들과 일반인들 사이의 빈부격차는 여전히 심각합니다. 사회에 더 많은 돈을 환원환다면 일반인의 삶을 향상시킬 수 있고 회사측에도 정치 분야에 투입할 인력이 줄어든다는 점에서 이익이 됩니다."
COS_German_Cultural_Program:0 "독일 문화 교류 프로그램"
COS_German_Cultural_Program_desc:0 "우리나라와 독일권 유럽 국가들 사이의 강한 유대관계는 예술품, 문학 작품, 문화 유산의 교류로 이어졌습니다. 독일과 플랜더스-왈로니아 전역의 대학은 우리나라 고등 교육의 큰 부분을 부담하고 있으며, 국민들의 사고 방식에 큰 영향을 끼쳤습니다."
COS_Extend_Loan_decision:0 "대출 확대"
COS_Extend_Loan_decision_desc:0 "계속되는 불경기와 현재 맹위를 떨치는 재앙인 검은 월요일에서 이익을 얻은 투자자들과 부유한 자본가들이 커피 회사를 구제하는데 필요한 자본을 대출해주었습니다. 지금 채권자들이 돈을 달라고 독촉하고 있는데 비해 우리에게는 자금이 없습니다. 그들에게 작은 정치적 양보를 제공하고 국가 토지 일부를 매각함으로서 문제를 완화시킬 수는 있겠지만, 근본적인 해결책은 되지 못할 겁니다."
COS_Sell_Government_Land_decision:0 "국유지 매각"
COS_Sell_Government_Land_decision_desc:0 "수십년동안 중앙아메리카 정부는 어마어마한 플랜테이션 부지 매각을 통해 외국계 기업의 경제 상태를 지지해주는 한편으로, 해당 기업을 이용해왔습니다. 우리도 그렇게 하는게 좋겠지요. 그렇지 않나요?"
COS_Land_Survey:0 "획득 토지 측량"
COS_Land_Survey_desc:0 "우리나라 국토 대부분이 농경에 적합하다고 해도, 모든 농토가 커피 농사에 적격인건 아닙니다. 토지를 측량하고 필요로 하는 만큼의 가치가 있는지 아닌지 파악하는 것이 저들의 투자 성공에 굉장히 중요합니다."
COS_Extend_Connections:0 "철도망 확장"
COS_Extend_Connections_desc:0 "플렌테이션이 계속 성장하고 산업이 커나가면서 더 나은 기반시설에 대한 요구도 함께 증가하고 있습니다. 19세기 케이스의 선례를 따라 커피 회사는 우리가 플랜테이션에 사용할 농지를 더 제공한다면 철도를 깔아 주겠다고 제안했습니다."
COS_Hire_Foreign_Engineers:0 "외국인 기술자 고용"
COS_Hire_Foreign_Engineers_desc:0 "철도 건설 중에 소규모 광물 매장지가 확인되었습니다. 커피 회사는 곧바로 매장지의 채산성을 조사하고 교량과 터널 건설에 도움을 줄 수 있는 유럽인 기술자들을 고용하기 시작했습니다."
COS_Plantation_Expansion:0 "커피 회사 플렌테이션 확대"
COS_Plantation_Expansion_desc:0 "회사 운영진과 투자자들의 긍정적인 반응과 정부의 재빠른 대응으로 인해 새로운 플렌테이션 건설에 대한 합의가 이루어졌습니다. 대부분 노동력을 코스타리카 국민에 의존하고 대서양노동자의회의 요구를 수용하겠다는 조건으로 모든 관련자들이 합의에 이르렀습니다. 이후 토지가 배정되었고 플렌테이션이 운영되기 시작했습니다."

COS_Build_New_Telephone_Lines_desc:0 "국토 양극단 사이의 통신 문제는 항상 의사소통의 문제나 부정부패로 직결되는 굉장히 까다로운 문제였습니다. 과일 회사는 우리가 자메이카 이주 노동자 유입을 막지 않겠다는 약속과 추가적인 양보를 조건으로 무역 영향력과 전문지식을 이용하여 전신망을 확장해 주겠다고 제안했습니다."
COS_Establish_UFC_Headquarters_decision:0 "푸에르토 리몬에 과일 회사 본부 설립"
COS_Establish_UFC_Headquarters_decision_desc:0 "미국이 혼란에 빠지고 중앙아메리카 국가들이 과일 회사의 독점에서 벗어날 기회를 엿보고 있습니다. 회사측은 코스타리카 지부를 확장하고 리몬을 카리브해 지역 운영 본부로 운영할 것을 제안했습니다."
COS_Limon_Bananas:0 "리몬에 바나나 플랜테이션 개발"
COS_Limon_Bananas_desc:0 "전국토에 철도를 건설하는 대가로 과일 회사에 농작권을 넘긴 이래로 케이스가 처음 운영을 시작했습니다. 이후 바나나 붐이 지역을 강타했고 지역 전체의 모습을 완전히 변형시켜 버렸습니다. 자메이카에서 온 수천명의 흑인 노동자들이 농장 노동자로 유입되었습니다. 계속되는 국유지 판매와 주요 항만인 푸에르토 리몬 항구의 지원이 이 지역을  경제 중심지로 발전시켰습니다."
COS_Jamaica_Sugar:0 "자메이카에 설탕 플랜테이션 개발"
COS_Jamaica_Sugar_desc:0 "18세기에 영국령 서인도제도로 처음 편입되었고 이후 현재 서인도 연방 가맹국인 자메이카 섬은 항상 유럽 대륙에 설탕을 수출하는 주요한 국가였습니다. 영국의 대규모 투자와 광범위한 노예 활용을 통해 자메이카 섬은 초기부터 오랜 기간 동안 설탕 농장 규모를 엄청나게 키워왔습니다. 여전히 설탕이 주요 수출품이라는 점에서 그런 사실을 읽어낼 수 있습니다.\n\n과일 회사의 투자자들은 자메이카의 풍부한 플랜테이션에 관심을 보여왔습니다. 천천하지만 확실히 이익을 증대하기 위해 섬에서 토지를 매입하기 시작했습니다."
COS_Jamaica_Bananas:0 "자메이카에 바나나 플랜테이션 개발"
COS_Jamaica_Bananas_desc:0 "1870년 로렌조 도우 베이커라는 선원이 설립한 보스턴 과일 회사는 자메이카 섬에서 과일 회사가 처음으로 운영한 사례였습니다. 후에 키이스의 기업과 합병하면서 유나이티드 프루트 컴퍼니는 권력을 얻었고 섬에서 가장 큰 고용주가 되었습니다. 따라서 자메이카에서 지속적으로 운영 규모를 증대시키는 일은 매우 중요하며, 다음 행동을 계획할 때 우선 순위를 부여할 필요가 있습니다."
COS_Cuba_Sugar:0 "쿠바에 설탕 플랜테이션 개발"
COS_Cuba_Sugar_desc:0 "주로 오리엔테 지방에 집중된 쿠바에서의 과일 회사의 지분은 다른 지역과 달리 국가 정치에 영향을 끼칠 정도로 크지 않습니다. 하지만 섬에는 여러 설탕 공장이 존재하며, 이것을 계속 유지하는 것이 우리와 회사의 이익 모두에게 도움이 될 겁니다."

Since the local Costa Ricans had little intention to join the UFC on their banana crusade and were perfectly content with the coffee trade, Keith was forced to import more and more Jamaicans to work his fields. Weary of outsiders in their land however, the Costa Ricans never fully embraced their new citizens and kept a distinct distance from them. Over the years this has led to friction between the two parties which only escaped escalation due to the geographical features keeping them apart.\n\nFaltering profits from the coffee trade however and a general consciousness amongst the negro population have let the two groups once more collide. Costa Ricans are protesting what they see as a threat to their culture, aliens escaping from their designated area in the Limon province whilst the Blacks urge that the government treats them as equal citizens of the republic."

When later that day in a closed door meeting between the German delegation, the topic concerning the instability in the USA arose, the captain of the vessel handed over his orders to our president that the security of Costa Rica is of vital interest to the German people and that troops, supplies and even full protection could be arranged should instability in the region continue to mount."

We need a strong ally if we wish to survive and we need him now!

In 1911 the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Edward D. White, was asked to arbitrate. He rendered his decision in 1914, but Panama did not accept it, alleging that it favored Costa Rica. Hostilities broke out in 1921, when Costa Rica invaded the area. Panama recaptured the area easily. The conflict spread, however, when Costa Rica moved into the province of Bocas del Toro. Fearing that its interests might be threatened, the United States forced Panama to accept the White decision.\n\nAs our American allies have now fallen into anarchy, the Panamanian government has reopened the dispute and is demanding that we hand over the territory or face their army on the battlefield. Whilst our troops have recently grown in size, we are still completely outmatched by our Panamanian neighbours and will need foreign assistance if we are to become victorious.\n\nOur allies however are less eager to fight yet another pointless war and would prefer a more diplomatic solution to the crisis by re-enforcing the Fallo White ruling and forcing Panama to back down once and for all."

Demanding new and better laws have ultimately culminated in the creation of the so-called Collective agreement between the workers and the companies responsible.

Finally agreeing on many of the labour concerns pressed by the syndicalist Manuel Mora, the company was backed into a corner whilst the government refused to assist them in the matter.\n\nAchieving minimum wages that would not be given in company coupons, six hour shifts, recognition of injury law and many other concessions, this is a great success for the Costa Rican left and has also led to the creation of the first actual trade unions, expanding where the Atlantic Workers Congress had laid the foundations.\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall, the ZKG has also ratified the new Labour Accord and has expressed their full desire to work with the workers to create a better and safer work environment"

Waning interest by the people however and a lack of homegrown plays suited for the prestige of the building however have left it in a somewhat neglected state.\n\nThat was until a company of Flemish-Wallonian investors travelling through the nation during a trade mission sent out by Mitteleuropa came upon the site, instantly falling in love with the institution. Promising to send aid and performers from their homeland, the Teatro has received a sizeable grant to continue its operations with. When a recent reportage was subsequently featured in the Flemish-Wallonian paper De Standaard, a public crowdfunding campaign to support the Teatro was started with great success across their nation.\n\nPresented today by the Ambassador from Mitteleuropa, a small ceremony was held in front of the building in which the grant was symbolically exchanged for a bag of Costa Rican coffee beans."

"Costa Rica has more teachers than soldiers" is one of the favorite ways a Costa Rican describes his country and this pride is deeply nested.\n\nThat is until now as President Calderon has recently announced dramatic changes to primary and secondary education based on his inspiration source, the Papal encyclical "Rerum Novarum". "religion should be obeyed; that a high standard of morality should prevail, both in public and private life." Based on these ideas, Calderon not only reverted the 1894 ban on teachers from monastic orders but even obligated parents who want their child excluded from Catholic teachings to personally deliver a written not to the teacher, by doing so making children who use such notes be seen as "special" and laughing stocks for the others."

Though many leaders had placed family members in positions of power, Calderón's brother has become infamous for doling out non-competitive government contracts to cronies and people who pay him bribes. This has led him to acquire the nickname “Paco a Medias” because allegedly he demands a 50% kickback up front before offering contracts.\n\nEven though Calderon announced himself as a president of the people for the people, the economic mismanagement of his nation and the catastrophic increase in corruption are weighing heavily on the nation."

cos.122.d:0 "Whilst often criticized for being harsh or severe in punishment, the government of [COS.GetLeader] has profiled itself as one of order, discipline and strict punctuality. Vigorously promoting the honesty and efficiency of the Public Employees, Castro himself has on more than one occasion been seen patrolling the government offices early in the morning to inspect the punctuality and attendance of his employees. Should he spot that one of his subordinates is slacking or is taking bribes, he will immediately be requested to resign no matter his political affiliations.\n\nWhilst this policy has turned many of Castros former friends against him, he is praised by the common man for combating corruption and making the state run more efficiently."

cos.123.d:0 "Written by famous leader of the Atlantic Workers Congress, Carlos Luis Fallas, the novel "Mamita Yunai" has been recepted very well by the working class and has been praised as one of the greatest literary works in Costa Rican history.\n\nRacounting the tale of a man named José Francisco Sibaja, an activist of the Workers and Peasants Block, the novel starts when he is sent by his party to control a vote in Talamanca that is known to be fraudulent. Traveling to one of the last areas populated by Indians, where almost no Spanish is spoken, this first part, recounts the vicissitudes through which Sibajita goes to find the polling station and reach it, despite the obstacles put by local authorities. The activist understands his impotence and tries at least to substantially reduce the extent of the fraud in which he partially succeeds by convincing the police chief and local representatives. In the end however, his effort proves to be but a drop of water in the sea and he return back to Limon content with his succes and unaware of how little impact his actions have had.\n\nDescribing in great detail the poverty and harsh lifes of the Indians he encounters, the tale is meant to be shocking and eye-opening for the establishement in charge and to show the people how little they have done."

cos.125.d:0 "The nation was taken by surprise today when Deutscher Aero Lloyd Flight 134 with destination Buenos Aires was rerouted to San José earlier this morning when an as of yet unidentified organisation, presumably syndicalist, hijacked the plane just over Portugal forcing the crew to reroute to Central America. Shortage of fuel however kept the plane from touching down in Nicaragua and forced the plane to refuel in San José, carrying 34 passengers.\n\nDon Pepe, who was holding a speech in Puriscal only 20 miles from the capital, was immediately notified of the situation and was requested authorisation to refuel the plane. What the terrorists however didn't count on was the response of our president who instead of complying to their demands jumped into the closest vehicle headed for the airport radioing the National Guard to refuse and act as he said to "terrorise the terrorists". Demanding the plane to be encircled, its tires deflated and all possible exits cut off, the president ended his answer shouting into his radio "Boys, this is war!".\n\nBy the time the President arrived, all passengers apart from the flight crew who were kept as hostages were released. One of the stewards pleaded, "For the love of God, let us go to Nicaragua! Otherwise, they'll kill us". Ferrers answer was immediate. He directed that tear gas be pumped into the planes ventilation system followed by an assault team who stormed the aircraft. Grabbing a sub-machine gun from his personal guards, the President himself led the charge. No innocent casualties occurred in this dramatic action but all terrorists were executed on the spot, resulting in the incident marking the headline of newspapers all across the world, congratulating the President for his brave and decisive action."
