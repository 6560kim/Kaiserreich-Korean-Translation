saud.1.t:0 "네지드 에미르국"
saud.1.d:0 "The Weltkrieg was one of many signs that we, the House of Saud, are destined the rule this land. In the hour of his greatest hubris, the Hashemites were abandoned by their infidel puppet masters and left for dead to the Turks and their puppet masters. While our inactivity in the war proved most fortuitous when it came time to avoid Ottoman retaliation, the decadent Turks hold no real sway over us; the conquest of Qatar and the Trucial Coast were made all on our own. Now we bide our time, gathering warriors, money, and expertise to strike at the Rashidis, who think they can play both sides by accepting Hashemite warriors and pay lip service to the Porte, and finally unite Arabia under our flag!"

### Events ###
saud.150.t:0 "이크완 반란!"
saud.150.d:0 "The Ikhwan has been a strong army presence in Arabia for decades. They were also one of the principle reasons we were able to succeed in defeating the other Arab states and assert Saudi dominance in the region. However, the Ikhwan have always been a traditional group, highly religious, and vehemently against change and reform. They do not seem to understand that modernisation is necessary when ruling a nation. Normally, we can control any anger felt by the Ikhwan with promises that we won't modernise any more. However, it seems we've pushed them too far this time. Ikhwan soldiers have united under the leadership of Faisal Al Duwaish, an Ikhwan commander, who has declared that the Saudis are unfit to rule Arabia. Many Ikhwan militia have risen up, and fighting has already begun..."
